This guideline is t he basis of QS203 . 
Overview 
This guideline co vers diagnosing, monit oring and managing an y type of primar y brain 
tumour or brain metastases in people aged 16 or o ver. It aims t o impr ove diagnosis and 
care, including standar dising t he car e people ha ve, ho w inf ormation and suppor t are 
provided, and palliativ e car e. 
In Januar y 2021 , we replaced our r ecommendation on sur gical ca vity radiosur gery and 
radiot herap y wit h a link t o the NHS England commissioning policy on st ereotactic 
radiosur gery and st ereotactic radiot herap y to the sur gical ca vity f ollowing r esection of 
cerebral metastases . 
Who is i t for? 
• Healt hcare professionals in volved in t he multidisciplinar y car e of people wit h primar y 
brain tumours or brain metastases 
• Commissioners and pr oviders of brain tumour ser vices 
• People using ser vices f or the diagnosis, management and car e of a primar y brain 
tumour or brain metastases, and t heir f amilies and car ers Brain tumours (primar y) and brain metastases in o ver 16s (NG99)

Key recommenda tions f or research 
1 Manag ing g lioma: manag emen t of IDH wild type gr ade II glioma 
Does t he addition of concurr ent and adjuv ant t emoz olomide t o radiot herap y impr ove 
overall sur vival in patient s wit h IDH wildtype grade  II glioma? 
Why this is impor tant 
The W orld Healt h Organization (WHO) 2016 r eclassification of brain tumours r ecognised 
that t he molecular charact eristics of glioma ar e extremely impor tant in helping 
differentiat e betw een disease entities wit h very diff erent out comes. Alt hough e vidence 
exists to guide management r ecommendations f or cer tain molecular gliomas, such as 
codelet ed and non-codelet ed grade  III glioma, curr ently no studies ha ve investigat ed the 
best appr oach f or the management of grade  II glioma wit h IDH wildtype. The biological 
beha viour of t hese tumours is mor e like a high-grade glioma wit h a much shor ter 
prognosis t han IDH-mutat ed grade  II glioma. 
Because of t his, some clinicians ha ve adv ocated tr eating such tumours wit h concurr ent 
chemoradiation r ecommended f or grade  IV glioma ( glioblast oma multif orme, GBM). 
However, there is curr ently no r esear ch evidence t o suppor t this appr oach and t his

Resear ch is needed t o establish whet her or not t his appr oach is beneficial in t erms of 
improved sur vival, and at what cost in t erms of t oxicity and, pot entially , reduced quality of 
life. Brain tumours (primar y) and brain metastases in o ver 16s (NG99)

2 Manag ing g lioma: suppor tive care clinics f or lo w-grade g lioma 
Does a dedicat ed suppor tive car e clinic in addition t o standar d car e impr ove out comes f or 
people wit h low-grade gliomas? 
Why this is impor tant 
People wit h low-grade gliomas ha ve significant sympt oms and comple x healt hcare needs 
across multiple ph ysical, cognitiv e, emotional and social domains. This is oft en fr om t he 
initial diagnosis onwar ds. Ther e are indications fr om resear ch lit eratur e and patient r epor ts 
that t hese needs ar e curr ently unmet. Helping people wit h low-grade gliomas maintain 
their quality of lif e and function is impor tant, especially as t here is curr ently no cur e, 
because earlier suppor tive car e interventions and car e plans ma y help r educe unplanned 
or emer gency contact wit h secondar y and t ertiary providers. 
As no r esear ch lit eratur e exists which establishes t he eff ectiv eness of a specific 
healt hcare intervention, uncer tainty e xists about t he most appr opriat e intervention t o 
addr ess unmet needs and impr ove patient -repor ted out come measur es (or to establish 
whet her curr ent healt hcare provision can meet t hese needs). Curr ent uncer tainty is lik ely 
to have led t o variations in ser vice pr ovision acr oss t he UK. It is also possible t hat no 
specific int ervention is a vailable in some ar eas. 
Resear ch is needed t o identify whet her, in addition t o standar d car e, a specific suppor tive

3 Manag ing g lioma: e arly referral to pallia tive care for 
glioblastoma 
Does early r eferral t o palliativ e car e impr ove out comes f or people wit h glioblast omas in 
comparison wit h standar d oncology car e? 
Why this is impor tant 
People wit h grade  IV brain tumours ( glioblast omas) ha ve a poor pr ognosis which has not 
improved in o ver a decade. Median o verall sur vival is 14–18  mont hs even wit h gold-
standar d chemoradiation f ollowing sur gery. 
From initial diagnosis people e xperience multiple comple x sympt oms r esulting fr om 
neurological impairment. These can significant ly impact on t heir quality of lif e, function and 
psychological w ellbeing. Their car egivers r epor t high le vels of distr ess and car er bur den. 
The aim of palliativ e car e is t o relieve sympt oms and impr ove people's quality of lif e and 
function – not just t owards the end of lif e but t hroughout t he duration of illness. Ther e is 
some e vidence t hat early palliativ e car e referral significant ly impr oves overall sur vival, 
quality of lif e and mood. 
Resear ch in t his ar ea is impor tant because t his gr oup of people ha ve substantial healt h 
needs, which use significant healt hcare resour ces. Suppor tive car e interventions such as 
early palliativ e car e ma y impr ove quality of lif e and function t hroughout t he duration of 
illness. It ma y also help people t o manage t he distr ess associat ed wit h a reduced lif e 
expectancy and par ticipat e in adv anced car e planning. Brain tumours (primar y) and brain metastases in o ver 16s (NG99)

4 Manag ing g lioma: e arly detection o f recurr ence after tr eatmen t 
Does early det ection of r ecurr ence aft er treatment impr ove overall sur vival/out comes in 
molecularly stratified glioma? 
Why this is impor tant 
Prognosis f or brain tumours is inher ently uncer tain, and r ecent adv ances in tr eatment 
mean man y people wit h a brain tumour will liv e for a long time aft er the initial diagnosis. 
For these individuals, f ollow-up is t he longest component of t heir tr eatment and it is bot h 
expensiv e for the NHS and (sometimes) a bur den f or the person. Ther e is no high-quality 
evidence t hat f ollow-up aft er treatment is beneficial, no high-quality e vidence on t he 
optimal fr equency of imaging, and clinical uncer tainty about whet her such f ollow-up is 
likely to alter out comes of impor tance t o people wit h tumours (such as o verall lif e 
expectancy or quality of lif e).

radiother apy for inc ompletely excised grade I mening ioma 
Is immediat e or def erred radiot herap y bett er for incomplet ely e xcised grade  I meningioma? 
Why this is impor tant 
Ther e are no randomised studies on t he use of radiot herap y/radiosur gery in t he tr eatment 
of grade  I meningioma. Though case series ha ve sho wn that people wit h inoperable and 
incomplet ely e xcised grade  I meningioma tr eated wit h radiot herap y have high rat es of 
contr ol of t heir tumour , treatment risks significant side eff ects. The side eff ects include: 
neuropat hy, radionecr osis, significant oedema, neur o-cognitiv e eff ects, incr eased risk of 
stroke and secondar y tumours. Ther efore the timing of tr eatment is a balance betw een 
contr ol of tumour and side eff ects. It is not kno wn if early tr eatment has a gr eater or lesser 
chance of long-t erm tumour contr ol or risk of tumour complications, or if t his just risks 
complications of tr eatment earlier . 
People wit h grade  I meningioma ha ve traditionally been o verlook ed as a priority ar ea for 
resear ch. This is lik ely because of t he slo w natur e of t he disease r esulting in need f or long-
term f ollow-up and t he difficulty t o obtain funding f or radiot herap y-only studies. Ho wever, 
this lack of r esear ch is inequitable, hence t he reason f or its prioritisation b y the committ ee. 
A study on t his topic w ould pr ovide clear inf ormation t o guide clinicians and people wit h 
meningiomas, hopefully leading t o overall impr ovement in quality of lif e. Because of t he 
slow-gr owing charact eristics of grade  I meningioma, tr eatment decisions made early in t he 
management pat hway will ha ve long-t erm eff ects on t he person wit h the meningioma's 
overall quality of lif e out comes, and pot entially o verall sur vival.

they might aff ect practice. The y link t o details of t he evidence and a full description of t he 
committ ee's discussion. 
Investig ations f or suspe cted glioma: imag ing 
The discussion belo w explains ho w the committ ee made recommendations 1 .1.1–1.1.3. 
Why the c ommi ttee made the r ecommenda tions 
The e vidence indicat ed that standar d structural MRI is useful in distinguishing high-grade 
from lo w-grade glioma. The committ ee not ed that t his kno wledge will inf orm management. 
Based on t heir e xperience, t he committ ee recommended a pr otocol t hat t hey defined as a 
minimum standar d for imaging acquisition. 
No e vidence was f ound on mor e adv anced MRI t echniques. Ho wever, the committ ee 
agreed t hat in t heir e xperience such t echniques can be useful f or assessing malignant 
featur es of a tumour – in par ticular , for ensuring t hat high-grade tumours ar e not 
misdiagnosed as lo w-grade tumours, which could ha ve serious consequences f or people 
who r eceiv e suboptimal management as a r esult. Ho wever the committ ee explained t hat a 
specialist multidisciplinar y team w ould be needed t o interpret featur es of t he scan and 
decide management, e ven if adv anced t echniques w ere used. 
How the r ecommenda tions mig ht affect practice 
Currently, various imaging strat egies ar e used in diff erent centr es and depending on t he 
person's cir cumstances. These r ecommendations aim t o reduce v ariation in practice, and 
ensur e that images obtained at diff erent sit es and using diff erent equipment can be mor e 
accurat ely compar ed. Some centr es ma y need t o change t heir imaging pr otocols. This 
might incr ease or r educe cost s depending on t he imaging pr otocols which ar e curr ently in 
place.

Investig ations f or suspe cted glioma: mo lecular 
markers 
The discussion belo w explains ho w the committ ee made recommendations 1 .1.4–1.1.6. 
Why the c ommi ttee made the r ecommenda tions 
Molecular mark ers ar e an emer ging and impor tant ar ea in t he tr eatment of brain tumours. 
The committ ee look ed for evidence on t hese mark ers but did not find an y. However, they 
noted that t here are some molecular mark ers for which t he evidence of benefit if t ested is 
overwhelming, as r epor ted in studies identified in sear ches f or ot her r eview questions. 
This applies in par ticular f or MGMT pr omot er met hylation and TERT pr omot er mutations in 
IDH-wildtype glioma, alt hough t he committ ee agr eed t he evidence was of a higher quality 
in the first case t han t he second. The committ ee agr eed t hat e ven these mark ers ar e not 
being consist ently tested for and t hat t esting should be standar dised. Ther efore they 
made r ecommendations based on t heir kno wledge and e xperience, highlighting t he W orld 
Healt h Organization (WHO) classification, t o ensur e that all centr es follow a consist ent 
process f or assessing and int erpreting inf ormation on molecular mark ers. This was 
impor tant, since f ailure to consist ently repor t molecular mark ers can mislead clinicians or 
limit tr eatment options. 
How the r ecommenda tions mig ht affect practice 
As testing f or molecular mark ers is r elativ ely new , practice can v ary widely and t his is t o be 
expect ed. In principle t here should not be a major change, alt hough t he time tak en to 
implement t he new molecular t ests will v ary significant ly betw een centr es.

Manag emen t of glioma: ini tial sur gery for lo w-
grade g lioma 
The discussion belo w explains ho w the committ ee made recommendations 1 .2.1–1.2.5. 
Why the c ommi ttee made the r ecommenda tions 
Ther e was e vidence t hat optimal r esection of a lar ge per centage of t he tumour impr oved 
survival for people wit h low-grade glioma. The committ ee not ed that it is sometimes not 
appr opriat e to off er maximal saf e resection (f or example, if t he balance of risks and 
benefit s favours not r esecting all ar eas) and t hat a specialist sur gical t eam should look at 
the value of doing an operation giv en its saf e extent. The y agr eed t hat biopsy should be 
consider ed in t hese cases, based on limit ed evidence sho wing impr oved overall sur vival 
after biopsy compar ed wit h activ e monit oring. Ho wever, the committ ee also concluded 
that some tumours w ere of such limit ed risk t hat t he risks of sur gery outw eighed t he 
possible gain of biopsy or r esection. 
The committ ee described ho w there was no e vidence f or immediat e intervention, but t hat 
intervention should not be dela yed due t o the pr obability t hat sur gical r esection w ould 
have benefit f or the person wit h the tumour . The y therefore recommended int ervention 
within 6  mont hs, to allo w for time t o discuss tr eatment options wit h the person wit h the 
tumour . This also allo ws for the possibility of a second imaging sequence t o be done lat er 
to look f or pr ogression and t o assess f or sympt om change, as t he committ ee also 
recognised t hat a pr opor tion of lo w-grade gliomas ha ve unf avourable gene pr ofiles (f or 
example, IDH wildtype) t hat mak e them mor e like high-grade tumours fr om a pr ognostic 
perspectiv e. 
A small number of people might ha ve had initial tr eatment bef ore it was standar d practice 
to save a tissue sample f or biopsy , and t hese people w ould curr ently be activ ely 
monit ored. Based on t heir e xperience t he committ ee agr eed t hat t hese people ma y not 
need fur ther sur gery as long as t heir condition is stable (t hat is, t hey are not sho wing 
radiological or clinical disease pr ogression). 
How the r ecommenda tions mig ht affect practice

partly because lo w-grade gliomas ma y be managed b y non-e xper t surgical t eams.

radiot herap y and PCV might not be appr opriat e (par ticularly f or the very lowest-concern 
and highest -concern lo w-grade tumours) and made r ecommendations based on t heir

Why the c ommi ttee made the r ecommenda tions 
Ther e was e vidence t hat 5-aminole vulinic acid (5-AL A), intraoperativ e MRI and diffusion 
tensor imaging could impr ove either t he extent or saf ety of r esection (par ticularly t he 
preservation of neur ological function). The committ ee not ed that a combination of 
techniques might be needed t o optimise bot h the extent and saf ety of r esection f or a 
particular sur gical plan. The committ ee concluded t hat t he evidence f or MRI could be 
generalised t o intraoperativ e ultrasound on t he basis of t heir clinical e xperience, and 
therefore that clinicians should be able t o choose eit her t echnique depending on 
availability . 
The e vidence f or awak e craniot omy was equiv ocal (non-significant diff erences compar ed 
with sur gery under general anaest hesia), t herefore from t he evidence it was not possible 
to conclude t hat awak e craniot omy would benefit all people wit h glioma. This is in line wit h 
the committ ee's clinical e xperience t hat some people benefit fr om t he pr ocedur e (in t erms 
of pr eserving language, mot or and visual function) but ot hers ar e harmed – par ticularly 
from psy chological eff ects which act as a contraindication t o awak e craniot omy. The 
committ ee described ho w bett er pr eoperativ e procedur es could r educe t he number of 
people distr essed b y the pr ocedur e. 
How the r ecommenda tions mig ht affect practice 
Some t echniques r ecommended b y the committ ee requir e a v ery high le vel of 
intraoperativ e skill, and t his might ha ve resour ce implications f or hospitals r ecruiting 
people wit h these specialist skills. Ther e is significant v ariation in t he curr ent pr ovision of 
psychological suppor t for people bef ore and during awak e craniot omy, and implementing 
this could carr y a high cost t o an individual unit. 
If a unit does not ha ve access t o intraoperativ e ultrasound or MRI, t he cost of acquiring 
this equipment could be substantial (MRI is r elativ ely e xpensiv e, ultrasound is r elativ ely 
cheap ). Ho wever the committ ee concluded t hat most unit s should ha ve access t o one or 
the ot her alr eady . Ther efore the only r esour ce impact w ould be if a unit curr ently using

It is estimat ed there are around 10 ,000 new cases of primar y brain tumours per y ear.

high-grade gliomas (anaplastic gliomas and glioblast omas) and pr e-malignant lo w-grade 
gliomas come fr om t he brain tissue glial cells, and mak e up o ver 60% of primar y brain 
tumours. Meningiomas mak e up a fur ther 30%. Alt hough oft en thought benign, 
meningiomas can ha ve an acut e presentation and ar e associat ed wit h significant long-

Over 60% of people wit h primar y brain tumours pr esent at, and ar e diagnosed b y, accident

causes a significant demand on t hese ser vices. Alt hough primar y malignant brain tumours 
represent only 3% of all cancers, t hey result in t he most lif e-years lost of an y cancer . Ther e

especially in deliv ering suppor t to people at home. The peak age of pr esentation of brain 
cancer is betw een 65  and 69, and t here are concerns t hat deliv ery of all ser vices t o these
