Recommenda tions 
People ha ve the right t o be in volved in discussions and mak e informed decisions 
about t heir car e, as described in NICE's inf ormation on making decisions about y our 
care. 
Making decisions using NICE guidelines  explains ho w we use w ords to sho w the 
strengt h (or cer tainty) of our r ecommendations, and has inf ormation about 
prescribing medicines (including off -label use), pr ofessional guidelines, standar ds 
and laws (including on consent and mental capacity), and saf eguar ding. 
1.1 Comm unic ation and suppor t 
1.1.1 Provide inf ormation and suppor t to people wit h myeloma or primar y plasma cell 
leukaemia and t heir f amily members or car ers (as appr opriat e), par ticularly at 
diagnosis, at t he beginning and end of each tr eatment, at disease pr ogression 
and at transition t o end of lif e car e. 
1.1.2 Consider pr oviding t he following inf ormation in an individualised manner t o 
people wit h myeloma and t heir f amily members or car ers (as appr opriat e): 
• the disease pr ocess, r elapse and r emission cy cle, and t he person's o verall 
prognosis 
• the tr eatment plan, including (if appr opriat e) the pr ocess and t he pot ential 
benefit s, risks and complications of st em cell transplantation 
• sympt oms of m yeloma and tr eatment -related side eff ects (including 
steroid-r elated side eff ects, inf ection and neur opat hy) 
• lifestyle measur es to optimise bone healt h and r enal function 
• how to identify and r epor t new sympt oms ( especially pain and spinal cor d 
compr ession) 
• the role of suppor tive and palliativ e car e Myeloma: diagnosis and management (NG35)

The Guideline Committ ee has made t he following r ecommendations f or resear ch. The 
Committ ee's full set of r esear ch recommendations is detailed in t he full guideline . 
1 Diagnostic in vestig ations to pr edict treatmen t 
outcomes 
What is t he pr ognostic v alue of t he He vylite assa y and ratio compar ed wit h other 
prognostic f actors and t ests, including t he serum-fr ee light -chain assa y and fluor escence 
in-situ h ybridisation (FISH), in people wit h newly diagnosed m yeloma who ar e star ting 
treatment? 
Why this is im portant 
Hevylite is a new assa y that some studies ha ve indicat ed is a useful pr ognostic t ool. 
However, it is not clear ho w robust ly it has been e valuat ed against ot her pr ognostic 
factors and t ests, or whet her it is an independent pr ognostic f actor. The He vylite assa y 
should be e valuat ed in an accr edited centralised laborat ory independent of links wit h the 
manuf actur er. Out comes of int erest ar e overall r esponse, complet e response, minimal 
residual disease, pr ogression-fr ee sur vival, overall sur vival and r esour ce use. 
2 Imag ing in vestig ations f or ne wly diagnose d 
myeloma 
What is t he comparativ e eff ectiv eness of whole-body MRI, fluor odeo xyglucose positr on 
emission t omograph y CT (FDG PET -CT) and whole-body lo w-dose CT in det ecting lesions 
that ma y det ermine t he star t of tr eatment f or people wit h newly diagnosed m yeloma? 
Why this is im portant 
New er imaging t echniques ar e replacing sk eletal sur veys for assessing m yeloma-r elated 
bone disease in people wit h newly diagnosed m yeloma. Ho wever, the most eff ectiv e 
technique is not kno wn. Out comes of int erest ar e lesion det ection, sensitivity and Myeloma: diagnosis and management (NG35)

3 Manag emen t of smouldering m yeloma 
Which combinations of FISH, molecular t echnologies, bone marr ow plasma cell 
percentage, whole-body imaging, immunophenotype, serum-fr ee light -chain le vels or 
ratio, He vylite, parapr otein le vels, immunopar esis, and Int ernational Staging Syst em (ISS) 
are most eff ectiv e at risk stratification f or people wit h smouldering m yeloma ? 
What is t he comparativ e eff ectiv eness of fix ed duration tr eatment (wit h or wit hout 
bone-dir ected therap y), continuous tr eatment (wit h or wit hout bone-dir ected therap y) and 
no tr eatment (wit h or wit hout bone-dir ected therap y) for people wit h smouldering 
myeloma? 
Why this is im portant 
Changes t o the Int ernational My eloma W orking Gr oup definitions of smouldering m yeloma 
and m yeloma ha ve aff ected the risk stratification pr ocess f or smouldering m yeloma. It is 
unclear if t he pr evious risk stratification appr oach r emains v alid. It is also unclear if earlier 
treatment will be of benefit t o people wit h smouldering m yeloma. This study should be a 
randomised multi-centr e prospectiv e trial f or patient s wit h newly diagnosed smouldering 
myeloma (as defined b y the International My eloma W orking Gr oup 2014 classification ). 
Outcomes of int erest ar e time t o biochemical and/or clinical pr ogression, o verall sur vival, 
adverse e vents, quality of lif e and r esour ce use. 
4 Allog eneic stem c ell tr ansp lantation 
What is t he eff ectiv eness of combined aut ologous–allogeneic st em cell transplantation 
compar ed wit h aut ologous st em cell transplantation, plus consolidation and maint enance 
treatment in chemosensitiv e patient s at first r esponse or first r elapse? 
Why this is im portant 
Ther e are conflicting data fr om a small number of studies on long-t erm sur vival following 
auto/allo st em cell transplantation compar ed wit h aut ologous st em cell transplantation. Myeloma: diagnosis and management (NG35)

These studies w ere per formed bef ore thalidomide, bor tezomib and lenalidomide w ere 
used as m yeloma tr eatment s. These drugs pr oduce bett er responses and also ha ve the 
capacity t o aff ect immunological r esponses aft er the transplant. R esear ch is needed t o 
see if t here is a r ole for aut o/allo st em cell transplant in t he ongoing tr eatment of m yeloma. 
Outcomes of int erest ar e progression-fr ee sur vival, overall sur vival, transplant -related 
mortality , quality of lif e, early and lat e toxicity including graft -versus-host -disease (GvHD) 
and r esour ce use. This r esear ch should be included as an option in appr opriat e 
mainstr eam clinical trials f or myeloma. 
5 Bisphosp hona tes f or the pr evention o f bone 
disease 
What is t he eff ectiv eness of mont hly z oledr onic acid giv en indefinit ely compar ed wit h 
zoledr onic acid giv en for a fix ed duration in patient s wit h myeloma? 
Why this is im portant 
Ther e is good-quality e vidence t o suppor t the use of z oledr onic acid t o prevent bone 
disease in people wit h myeloma. Ho wever, the optimal fr equency and duration of 
treatment is not clearly defined and needs fur ther r esear ch, par ticularly giv en the 
quality-of -life implications f or people needing r egular , life-long visit s to hospital. This study 
should be a randomised contr olled trial. Out comes of int erest ar e skeletal-r elated events, 
progression-fr ee sur vival, overall sur vival, utility of bone biomark ers, incidence of 
osteonecr osis of t he jaw , quality of lif e and r esour ce use. Myeloma: diagnosis and management (NG35)

Context 
Myeloma is a malignancy of t he plasma cells t hat normally pr oduce immunoglobulin. It 
affects multiple or gans and syst ems, including t he bones, kidne ys, blood and immune 
systems. 
Myeloma is t he se venteent h most common cancer in t he UK. In 2010 , 4672 people in t he 
UK w ere diagnosed wit h myeloma. It occurs mor e frequent ly in men and in people of 
African–Caribbean f amily origin. Diagnosis is oft en dela yed because t he sympt oms ar e not 
specific t o myeloma, and t his leads t o significant early morbidity and mor tality . 
Myeloma management is comple x and challenging. Eff ectiv e treatment s have been 
developed o ver the past 15  years, and alt hough m yeloma is still incurable t hese tr eatment s 
have led t o impr ovement s in o verall sur vival and quality of lif e. Ho wever, myeloma 
treatment incr easingly in volves expensiv e drugs and fr equent hospital visit s. 
Complications of m yeloma and m yeloma tr eatment cause an incr easing long-t erm strain on 
suppor tive and palliativ e car e ser vices, and on car ers. 
This guideline co vers ar eas in which t here is uncer tainty or v ariation in practice. It contains 
recommendations on: 
• communication and suppor t 
• laborat ory investigations and imaging t o diagnose m yeloma and det ermine fur ther 
treatment 
• managing bone disease and acut e renal disease 
• autologous and allogeneic st em cell transplantation 
• preventing and managing m yeloma- and tr eatment -induced complications 
• monit oring f or people wit h smouldering m yeloma  and m yeloma. 
Because of t he changes t o the International My eloma W orking Gr oup definition of 
smouldering m yeloma , it was not possible t o mak e any recommendations f or clinical 
practice on managing t his condition. The new definition has changed ho w smouldering 
myeloma and m yeloma ar e diff erentiat ed, and t here is curr ently no e vidence a vailable t hat
