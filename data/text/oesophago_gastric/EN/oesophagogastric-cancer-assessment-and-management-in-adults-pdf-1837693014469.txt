The aetiology of squamous cell car cinoma (SCC) of t he oesophagus is changing. Patient s 
with SCC ar e now fitt er, with fewer comorbidities t han in pr evious y ears. Standar d radical 
treatment f or SCC of t he oesophagus is usually chemoradiot herap y, which is associat ed 
with a median sur vival of betw een 12 and 18  mont hs. G iven a fitt er patient population, 
surgery ma y be a t herapeutic option but it s effectiv eness in addition t o 
chemoradiot herap y is unkno wn and a randomised contr olled study t o investigat e whet her 
the combination impr oves disease-fr ee and o verall sur vival would pr ovide useful 
information t o guide futur e clinical practice. 
4 Radic al treatmen t of T1b N0 adenoc arcinoma o f 
the oesop hagus 
What is t he optimal tr eatment f or T1bN0 adenocar cinoma of t he oesophagus? [2018] 
Why this is im portant 
In patient s wit h submucosal (T1b ) N0 oesophageal adenocar cinoma (O AC), the associat ed 
risk of lymph node metastases is estimat ed to be betw een 4% f or sub-mucosal 1 (sm 1) and 
up to 16% f or sm3 based on r etrospectiv e sur gical data. The majority of patient s wit h a 
submucosal T1bN0 O AC therefore curr ently ha ve major sur gical r esection wit hout 
detecting an y cancer cells in t he oesophagus or lymph nodes. Oesophagect omy is also a 
procedur e associat ed wit h significant morbidity (up t o 50%) and mor tality (2%  to 4%). 
In comparison , endoscopic mucosal r esection (EMR) and endoscopic submucosal 
dissection (ESD) ar e techniques t hat can r emove the submucosa wit h less morbidity and 
mortality t han sur gery and, pr oviding t here is no lymph node in volvement, can lead t o a 
cure. Ho wever, compar ed to sur gery nodal in volvement can only be assessed b y F-18 FDG 
PET-CT scanning and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), which ma y lead t o under -treatment of Oesophago-gastric cancer: assessment and management in adult s (NG83)

some patient s wit h T1b disease. 
A study t o assess which patient s should ha ve endoscopic t herap y or sur gery for T1bN0 
OAC would be useful, as t his w ould help pr event bot h under - and o ver-treatment of t his 
group of people. This could be a randomised contr olled trial comparing sur gery and 
endoscopic tr eatment. 
5 Nutritional suppor t after r adical sur gery 
What is t he optimal met hod of deliv ering nutritional suppor t to adult s after sur gery wit h 
curativ e intent f or oesophago-gastric cancer? [2018] 
Why this is im portant 
People who ha ve sur gery for oesophago-gastric cancer ha ve a pr olonged period wit hout 
adequat e oral intak e aft er sur gery. Oral, ent eral and par enteral nutrition suppor t strat egies 
are used t o suppor t people during t his time. Evidence suggest s that pr oviding some f orm 
of nutrition suppor t impr oves sur gical out comes. Ho wever, which of t hese met hods is t he 
safest and most eff ectiv e has not been det ermined and because of t his, practice in t his 
field v aries nationally . A study t o identify t he best met hod of deliv ering saf e and eff ectiv e 
nutritional suppor t interventions which aim t o reduce post -operativ e complications in t his 
population w ould help guide futur e clinical practice. 
6 Jejunostom y suppor t after r adical sur gery 
What is t he eff ectiv eness of long-t erm jejunost omy suppor t compar ed to intensiv e dietar y 
counselling and suppor t along wit h sympt om management f or people ha ving radical 
surgery for oesophago-gastric cancer? [2018] 
Why this is im portant 
People who ha ve had sur gery for oesophago-gastric cancer ha ve nutritional difficulties as 
a result of pr oblems eating, ongoing sympt oms, and side eff ects related to the sur gery. It 
is well recognised t hat t hey have a poor quality of lif e. Most patient s have adjuv ant 
treatment, ho wever their nutritional status ma y negativ ely impact on t heir ability t o tolerat e 
this, meaning tr eatment can be st opped early or not r eceiv ed. Jejunost omy feeding tubes 
are oft en used t o provide nutrition suppor t after dischar ge fr om hospital aft er sur gery. Oesophago-gastric cancer: assessment and management in adult s (NG83)

Some small studies ha ve sho wn a benefit in t erms of w eight pr eservation, but none ha ve 
shown that t his leads t o bett er recovery, tolerance of tr eatment or quality of lif e. Practice 
in this ar ea varies gr eatly, with some centr es placing jejunost omy tubes and continuing 
enteral f eeding aft er dischar ge, some placing t he jejunost omy tubes and not using t hem 
routinely and ot hers not placing jejunost omy tubes at all. Studies should aim t o identify if 
jejunost omy placement leads t o clinical benefit in adult s who ha ve had sur gery for 
oesophago-gastric cancer . 
7 Follow-up af ter tr eatmen t with cur ative intent 
Is the routine use of CT and tumour mark ers eff ectiv e in det ecting r ecurr ent disease 
suitable f or radical tr eatment in asympt omatic people who ha ve had tr eatment f or 
oesophago-gastric cancer wit h curativ e intent? [2018] 
Why this is im portant 
Ther e is no clearly defined f ollow-up pr otocol f or people wit h oesophago-gastric cancer 
treated radically . Det ection of early r ecurr ence pot entially suitable f or radical tr eatment 
offers t he possibility of incr eased sur vival. Ho wever, the best met hods of det ecting 
recurr ence ar e unclear and t here is no e vidence t o sho w whet her early det ection leads t o 
improved overall sur vival. The alt ernativ e is t o wait until sympt oms r eoccur and t hen r e-
evaluat e the fur ther tr eatment options a vailable. Studies e xamining t he role of scr eening in 
this scenario w ould sho w whet her r outine f ollow-up in asympt omatic people was eff ectiv e

Rationale and im pact 
This section briefly e xplains wh y the committ ee made t he recommendations and ho w they 
might aff ect practice. 
Luminal obstruc tion in oesop hageal and 
oesop hago-gastric junc tional c ancer 
Why the c ommi ttee made the r ecommenda tions 
Recommendations 1 .5.9 to 1.5.12 
The committ ee did not find an y new e vidence t hat w ould aff ect r ecommendations 1 .5.9 
and 1 .5.10 and t herefore did not updat e the recommendations made b y the pr evious 
committ ee on t he basis of t he evidence t hey consider ed (see t he previous full guideline 
from 2018 ). 
Most of t he evidence consider ed by the committ ee did not sho w a diff erence betw een t he 
effectiv eness of diff erent int erventions f or relieving dysphagia caused b y luminal 
obstruction of t he oesophagus in people wit h oesophageal and oesophago-gastric 
junctional cancer whose condition was not being tr eated wit h curativ e intent. A high 
quality , UK-based healt h technology assessment pr ovided new e vidence on e xternal beam 
radiot herap y (EBRT) aft er st enting f or people wit h dysphagia whose condition needed 
palliation. 
This study compar ed self -expanding metal st ents (SEMS) alone t o SEMS and adjuv ant 
EBRT and concluded t hat t he data could not diff erentiat e betw een t hem f or all out comes 
consider ed in t he evidence r eview . The committ ee agr eed t hat t hey did not suppor t the 
routine use of EBRT f or people aft er st enting. Ho wever, the committ ee not ed that t here 
was some e vidence of bett er out comes f or gastr ointestinal-r elated bleeding. Alt hough t his 
was of lo w cer tainty , they agr eed t hat fr om t heir e xperience EBRT helps t o prevent 
bleeding. Ther efore, they made a r ecommendation t o consider EBRT f or people wit h 
prolonged bleeding aft er st ent inser tion or a kno wn bleeding disor der. Stopping bleeding is 
impor tant t o people who ha ve incurable oesophageal and oesophago-gastric junctional 
cancer because it impr oves their quality of lif e. The committ ee made a recommendation Oesophago-gastric cancer: assessment and management in adult s (NG83)
© NICE 2025 . All right s reserved. Subject t o Notice of right s (https://www .nice.or g.uk/t erms-and-
conditions#notice-of -right s).Page 20 of
24
for resear ch about t he use of EBRT t o prevent bleeding  because t here was not enough 
evidence t o mak e a str ong r ecommendation about it. 
The committ ee agr eed t hat only off ering EBRT aft er st ent inser tion t o people wit h 
oesophageal and oesophago-gastric junctional cancer if t hey had pr olonged bleeding or a 
known bleeding disor der w ould lead t o mor e eff ectiv e tar geting of comparativ ely scar ce 
EBRT ser vices. F urthermor e, it will r educe t he tr eatment bur den f or people wit h 
oesophageal and oesophago-gastric junctional cancer who ar e not bleeding fr om t he 
cancer sit e, or do not ha ve a kno wn bleeding disor der, and t heir car ers and r elativ es. This 
is because t hey will not ha ve the incon venience of tra velling f or unnecessar y EBRT 
treatment and t he side eff ects associat ed wit h it. 
The committ ee made a recommendation f or resear ch on t he eff ectiv eness of ent eral 
feeding f or people who ha ve dysphagia caused b y luminal obstruction  as no e vidence was 
found. 
How the r ecommenda tions mig ht affect practice 
The committ ee agr eed t hat t he new r ecommendations ar e likely to be cost sa ving because 
they will r educe t he number of people r eceiving EBRT aft er st enting, and t he number of 
different tr eatment s that most people r eceiv e since most people will not r eceiv e EBRT . 
Resour ces f or EBRT aft er st ent inser tion can be mor e eff ectiv ely dir ected to people wit h 
incurable oesophageal and oesophago-gastric junctional cancer who ha ve prolonged 
bleeding or a kno wn bleeding disor der.

Context 
Ther e are around 13 ,000 new cases of oesophago-gastric cancer diagnosed in England 
each y ear. Mor tality rat es ar e high, wit h over 10 ,000 deat hs annually , and o ver the last 30 
years t he incidence of t hese cancers has continued t o incr ease. Early diagnosis r emains 
challenging, and optimising t he diagnostic and tr eatment pat hway is essential t o impr oving 
management and pr ognosis. 
At present t here is considerable v ariation in management and f ollow-up f or people 
diagnosed wit h oesophago-gastric cancer . Though t here have been r ecent adv ances in 
surgical t echniques and chemot herapeutic agent s, it is not y et clear ho w well these 
compar e wit h standar d therap y in t erms of impr oving sur vival and quality of lif e. 
This guideline co vers adult s and y oung people (18 y ears and o ver) who ar e referred to 
secondar y car e wit h suspect ed oesophago-gastric cancer , or who ha ve newly diagnosed 
or recurr ent disease. It co vers ar eas of uncer tainty or v ariation in practice in r elation t o 
diagnosis, staging and management of v arious aspect s of t he disease. Alt hough not 
intended as a compr ehensiv e guide t o the tr eatment of oesophago-gastric cancer , the 
information and suppor t needs of people aff ected, or ganisation of specialist t eams, initial 
assessment of disease and t he management of oesophago-gastric cancer in radical and 
palliativ e settings ar e all co vered. W e have also co vered related topics, such as nutritional 
suppor t.
