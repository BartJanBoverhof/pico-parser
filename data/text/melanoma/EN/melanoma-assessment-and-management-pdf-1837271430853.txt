7 Techniques f or confirming a diagnosis in pe ople wi th suspe cted 
atypic al Spitzoid melanoc ytic lesions 
In people wit h repor ted atypical Spitz oid lesions, ho w eff ectiv e are fluor escence in situ 
hybridization (FISH), comparativ e genomic h ybridization (CGH) and t ests to det ect driv er 
mutations compar ed wit h hist opat hological e xamination alone in pr edicting disease 
specific sur vival? 
This should be in vestigat ed in a pr ospectiv e diagnostic study . Secondar y out comes should 
include sensitivity , specificity , accuracy , positiv e predictiv e value, disease specific sur vival 
and pr ogression fr ee sur vival. [2015] 
Why this is impor tant 
Atypical Spitz oid lesions continue t o be diagnostically challenging. Ther e are no r eliably 
reproducible hist ological, immunohist ochemistr y or molecular f eatur es that allo w exact 
typing and pr ognostic assessment of t hese lesions. The curr ent 'gold standar d' is 
histological e xamination wit h exper t review , but it is not alwa ys possible t o distinguish 
Spitz oid melanoma fr om benign Spitz oid melanocytic lesions. 
Current molecular t echnologies such as FISH and CGH pr ovide some help, but t he result s 
are difficult t o interpret and ma y not be conclusiv e. Understanding and mapping changes 
in molecular pat hways could pr edict out come and inf orm individual tr eatment planning. Melanoma: assessment and management (NG14)

8 Surgical excision f or pe ople wi th len tigo maligna 
For people wit h lentigo maligna (stage  0 in sun damaged skin, usually on t he face) ho w 
effectiv e is Mohs micr ographic sur gery, compar ed wit h excision wit h a 0 .5 cm clinical 
margin, in pr eventing biopsy pr oven local r ecurr ence at 5  years? 
This should be in vestigat ed in a randomised contr olled trial. Secondar y out comes should 
include cosmetic and functional out comes. [2015] 
Why this is impor tant 
Mohs micr ographic sur gery is a micr oscopically contr olled sur gical t echnique designed t o 
allow complet e excision of t he tumour wit h minimal tissue loss. The t echnique can be 
useful f or people wit h lentigo maligna because t heir lesions can be v ery large and locat ed 
in a cosmetically sensitiv e site wher e sur gery ma y cause significant scarring. Ho wever, the 
histological det ection of small numbers of melanocyt es at t he edge of a sample is difficult, 
and can lead t o false negativ e result s. In addition, lentigo maligna ma y occur in an ar ea of 
field change wit h a risk of skip lesions at t he edge. Ther efore, alt hough Mohs micr ographic 
surgery ma y ensur e complet e excision of lentigo maligna, it can be accompanied b y the 
recurr ence of a similar lesion in adjacent skin. 
9 Vitamin D supp lemen tation 
In people wit h stage  I to III melanoma does vitamin D supplementation impr ove overall 
survival? 
This should be in vestigat ed in a placebo contr olled randomised trial. Secondar y out comes 
should include disease specific sur vival and t oxicity , including t he de velopment of r enal 
stones and h ypercalcaemia. [2015] 
Why this is impor tant 
It has been r epor ted that suboptimal le vels of vitamin D at diagnosis ar e common in people 
with melanoma fr om t he nor th of England and t hat higher le vels ar e associat ed wit h lower 
melanoma r elated mor tality . However, vitamin D le vels ar e higher in leaner , fitter people 
and t he natur e of t he relationship betw een vitamin D le vels and melanoma sur vival is 
unclear . Melanoma: assessment and management (NG14)

conditions#notice-of -right s).Page 31 of
47
Ther e are 2 adjuv ant trials of vitamin D supplementation list ed as activ e curr ently, 1 in Italy 
and 1 in Australia. Ho wever, there are man y uncer tainties about t he design of vitamin D 
trials, which might become clear er in t he ne xt few y ears. These include t he dose of vitamin 
D, use of concurr ent aspirin t herap y and t he baseline le vel at which vitamin D 
supplementation w ould be star ted. 
10 The ef fect of drug ther apy for concurr ent condi tions on 
melanoma sur vival 
In people diagnosed wit h melanoma what is t he eff ect of drug t herap y to treat concurr ent 
conditions on disease specific sur vival? 
This should be in vestigat ed in a national pr ospectiv e cohor t study . Secondar y out comes 
should include o verall sur vival and quality of lif e. [2015] 
Why this is impor tant 
Drugs such as immunosuppr essant s and t hose used t o treat conditions such as diabet es 
have eff ects that ma y affect sur vival in people wit h melanoma. F or example, metf ormin, 
the most fr equent ly prescribed drug f or type 2 diabet es, is t hought t o reduce o verall 
cancer rat es in people wit h diabet es but t o incr ease mor tality fr om melanoma in 
appr oximat ely 40% of t hese people who ha ve a somatic BRAF mutation. 
Ther e is a need t o balance t he risk of melanoma deat hs wit h the benefit s from t he most 
effectiv e treatment of t he concurr ent conditions. But t here is curr ently no e vidence t o 
inform t his decision. Melanoma: assessment and management (NG14)

Rationale and im pact 
These sections briefly e xplain wh y the committ ee made t he recommendations and ho w 
they might aff ect practice. 
BRAF anal ysis o f melanoma tissue sam ples 
Recommendations 1 .3.8 to 1.3.14 
Why the c ommi ttee made the r ecommenda tions 
Immunohist ochemistr y 
The 2015 guideline r ecommended genetic t esting f or stage  IIC and abo ve melanoma. The 
2022 committ ee extended t his b y recommending t hat BRAF analysis be consider ed for 
stage  IIA or IIB melanoma, and carried out f or stage  IIC to IV melanoma. The committ ee 
agreed, based on t heir e xperience and in view of adv ances in tar geted tr eatment s since 
2015 , that early det ermination of BRAF status has practical utility . The y not ed that disease 
relapse occurs in a significant pr opor tion of people wit h stage  IIA to IIC melanoma (up t o 
50% at 5  years in people wit h stage  IIC melanoma). Kno wing BRAF status can speed up 
decisions about tr eatment f or relapsed melanoma and optimise t he use of t hese new er 
treatment s. 
The committ ee also not ed that BRAF analysis of melanoma tissue samples should be 
arranged b y the local skin cancer multidisciplinar y team t o provide a mor e coor dinat ed 
process. The pat hology r epor t on t he primar y lesion should also include t he relevant tissue 
block suitable f or molecular genetic t esting, as specified b y the dermat opat hologist wit hin

The committ ee agr eed t hat MRI has utility during staging, due t o the incr eased sensitivity 
for det ecting brain metastases compar ed wit h CE-CT . The y recommended considering 
brain MRI inst ead of CE-CT when staging people wit h stage  IIIC t o IV melanoma because 
of their higher risk of de veloping brain metastases. The committ ee not ed that man y clinical

Why the c ommi ttee made the r ecommenda tions 
The committ ee agr eed t o retain t he 2015 r ecommendations on clinical mar gins f or

The 2015 committ ee found no e vidence on t he optimal clinical mar gin for stage  0

Evidence suppor ted the 2015 r ecommendations t o use minimum clinical mar gins of 1  cm in 
stage  I melanoma and 2  cm in stage  II melanoma. The mar gin should be ar ound t he 
histological biopsy scar and tak e into account t he primar y melanoma mar gins. The 
committ ee ackno wledged t hat smaller mar gins ma y be needed f or cosmetic r easons on

Why the c ommi ttee made the r ecommenda tions 
The committ ee look ed at e vidence on immunot herapies (ipilimumab, niv olumab, 
pembr olizumab, and niv olumab plus ipilimumab ) and tar geted therapies ( encoraf enib plus 
binimetinib, trametinib plus dabraf enib, dabraf enib monot herap y and v emuraf enib 
monot herap y). These t herapies w ere also compar ed in a healt h economic model. 
The committ ee not ed the comple xities and nuances in t he tr eatment pat hway. The y 
identified a number of f actors t hat should be tak en int o account when considering 
treatment choices t o allo w appr opriat e and individualised tr eatment decisions. 
The e vidence sho wed that, o verall, t he immunot herapies ar e mor e clinically eff ectiv e than 
the tar geted therapies. Wit hin the immunot herapies, niv olumab plus ipilimumab was t he 
most clinically eff ectiv e. The healt h economic model demonstrat ed that it is also t he most 
cost eff ectiv e. 
However, the committ ee not ed evidence sho wing t hat t he risk of t oxicity wit h 
immunot herapies is higher t han wit h tar geted therapies, and t hat t his risk incr eases when 
immunot herapies ar e used in combination. The y therefore agr eed t hat monot herap y 
should be an option if combination immunot herap y is deemed unsuitable f or people, f or 
example t hose wit h poor per formance status or comorbidities who ar e less lik ely to 
tolerat e toxicity . The e vidence sho wed that niv olumab and pembr olizumab ha ve similar 
clinical eff ectiv eness and cost eff ectiv eness when used as monot herapies so t he 
committ ee agr eed t hat eit her of t hese options should be off ered. 
The committ ee not ed NICE t echnology appraisal guidance r ecommending ipilimumab 
monot herap y for untr eated adv anced (unr esectable or metastatic) melanoma, but did not 
include t his option in t heir r ecommendation because it is not commonly used as first -line 
treatment and monot herap y wit h either niv olumab or pembr olizumab is mor e cost

for use as monot herap y in adult s and y oung people aged 12 and o ver. However, based on 
their clinical e xperience, it s use as a monot herap y is consider ed to be t he same as in Melanoma: assessment and management (NG14)

adult s. 
If immunot herap y, either in combination or as monot herap y, is unsuitable, t he committ ee 
agreed t hat tar geted therapies based on BRAF status ar e an option. The committ ee not ed 
that someone wit h sympt omatic brain metastases will usually need st eroids, which 
excludes tr eatment wit h immunot herap y. In addition, f or people wit h a high disease bur den 
or rapid pr ogression t here ma y not be enough time t o generat e the necessar y immune 
response t hat is associat ed wit h immunot herap y. Wit hin the tar geted therapies, e vidence 
showed that encoraf enib plus binimetinib, or trametinib plus dabraf enib, had similar clinical 
effectiv eness. The healt h economic model did not demonstrat e clear diff erences in cost 
effectiv eness betw een t hese 2 options. Ther efore, the committ ee agr eed t hat eit her of 
these options f or combination tr eatment could be r ecommended. If bot h of t hese options 
are unsuitable, t he committ ee agr eed t hat monot herap y wit h dabraf enib or v emuraf enib

If tar geted tr eatment f or BRAF-mutat ed melanoma is unsuitable, or if t he melanoma is 
BRAF-wild type, t he committ ee agr eed t hat t he options ar e limit ed to chemot herap y wit h 
dacarbazine or best suppor tive car e. 
The committ ee also made r ecommendations on tr eatment s for pr eviously tr eated stage  IV

No e vidence was f ound f or the eff ectiv eness of syst emic cancer t herapies specific t o

Frequency of f ollow-up 
The committ ee sought t o find a fr equency of clinical f ollow-up t hat w ould balance t he

Evidence sho wed that f or stage  IB to IIC disease, a lo wer frequency of f ollow-up visit s did 
not incr ease mor tality or cancer r ecurr ence, or w orsen quality of lif e. The committ ee 
therefore agr eed t o reduce t he fr equency of f ollow-up visit s. The y agr eed t o retain 4  visits 
per y ear f or the first 2  years aft er stages  IIB to IIC melanoma t o coincide wit h their 
recommended imaging fr equency , but t o reduce t his to 2 visits in y ear 3. 
Recommendations f or clinic visit s after resect ed stage  III to IV disease w ere made t o allo w 
for a clinic visit aft er each imaging scan. 
Imaging during f ollow-up 
The committ ee agr eed t hat CT scanning during f ollow-up aft er all stages of melanoma 
should include t he head because of t he fr equency of brain metastases de veloping during 
follow-up. The committ ee consider ed that t he radiation risk fr om e xposur e to ionising 
radiation during CE-CT scans was not serious. Ho wever, the committ ee agr eed t hat brain 
MRI could be consider ed inst ead of CE-CT , if it is mor e suitable (f or example, when t here 
are high-risk f actors associat ed wit h brain metastases or when MRI has been used in 
staging). This will r educe radiation e xposur e and pot entially incr ease accuracy of 
assessing brain metastases. The y not ed that t his should be aft er a discussion wit h the 
specialist skin cancer multidisciplinar y team. The committ ee ackno wledged t he logistical 
difficulties and incr eased bur den on MRI capacity of arranging separat e CE-CT and MRI

Evidence on stage  III melanoma suggest ed that while PET -CT is mor e sensitiv e for

agreed t hat fr equent imaging wit h CE-CT , par ticularly in t he first 2 t o 3 years when rat es 
of recurr ence ar e highest, will ensur e timely identification of r ecurr ences. The committ ee

Based on t his, t he committ ee agr eed t hat CE-CT imaging should be consider ed aft er

The committ ee agr eed t hat MRI should be off ered for childr en and y oung adult s having 
follow-up because of t he cumulativ e risk of radiation associat ed wit h CE-CT scanning, and 
during pr egnancy when CE-CT is undesirable. 
Ultrasound scanning was sho wn b y the evidence t o be mor e sensitiv e than clinical 
examination and alt ernativ e imaging modalities (par ticularly CE-CT) f or det ecting local 
lymph node metastases. The committ ee agr eed, based on t heir e xperience, t hat CE-CT 
alone can miss or dela y det ection of lymph node r ecurr ences. Ho wever, there was no good 
quality e vidence t o sho w that ultrasound r educes mor tality or time t o recurr ence in people 
with positiv e sentinel lymph nodes. Mor eover, in curr ent practice people wit h positiv e 
sentinel lymph nodes ar e off ered fr equent cr oss-sectional imaging and it is unclear 
whet her ultrasound off ers practical benefit abo ve and be yond t his imaging. This guideline 
does not r ecommend r outine completion lymph node dissection, based on e vidence 
comparing it wit h ultrasound scanning. Ho wever, there is no randomised contr olled trial 
evidence comparing completion lymph node dissection wit h sur veillance alone (wit h no 
ultrasound scanning). In addition, e vidence suggest ed that most nodal r ecurr ences 
develop wit hin the first f ew y ears of diagnosis. The committ ee not ed that nodal status is

The committ ee ackno wledged t he practical implications of ultrasound imaging during

Context 
Melanoma is t he fift h most common skin cancer in t he UK, accounting f or 4% of all new 
cancer cases and mor e cancer deat hs than all ot her skin cancers combined. During 2016 
to 2018 t here were 16,744 new cases of melanoma and 2, 333 deat hs fr om melanoma. Of 
those who de velop melanoma, 87% sur vive for 10  years or longer . 
Incidence rat es for melanoma skin cancer in t he UK ar e highest in people aged 85 t o 89. 
Each y ear mor e than a quar ter (29%) of all new melanoma skin cancer cases in t he UK ar e 
diagnosed in people aged 7 5 and o ver. Since t he early 1990s, melanoma skin cancer 
incidence rat es ha ve mor e than doubled (140%) in t he UK. Rat es in f emales ha ve around 
doubled (106%), and rat es in males ha ve almost tripled (186%), fr om 2016 t o 2018 . 
Incidence rat es for melanoma skin cancer ar e project ed to rise b y 7% in t he UK betw een 
2014 and 2035 , to 32 cases per 100 ,000 people b y 2035 . 
A person's risk of de veloping cancer depends on man y factors, including age, genetics, 
and e xposur e to risk f actors (including some pot entially a voidable lif estyle f actors). Most 
cases of melanoma (86%) in t he UK ar e preventable. Melanoma is most common in people 
with pale skin ho wever it is oft en diagnosed at a mor e adv anced stage in people wit h 
darker skin. This highlight s a need f or equal oppor tunity of diagnoses f or people wit h 
darker skin. The risk f actors ar e skin t hat t ends t o burn in t he sun, ha ving man y moles,
