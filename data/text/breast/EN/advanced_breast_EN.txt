or in a pr ocedur e should be r epor ted to the Medicines and Healt hcare product s Regulat ory 
Agency using t he Yellow Car d Scheme . 
Local commissioners and pr oviders of healt hcare have a responsibility t o enable t he 
guideline t o be applied when individual pr ofessionals and people using ser vices wish t o 
use it. The y should do so in t he cont ext of local and national priorities f or funding and 
developing ser vices, and in light of t heir duties t o have due r egar d to the need t o eliminat e

Recommenda tions 
People ha ve the right t o be in volved in discussions and mak e informed decisions 
about t heir car e, as described in NICE's inf ormation on making decisions about y our 
care. 
Making decisions using NICE guidelines  explains ho w we use w ords to sho w the 
strengt h (or cer tainty) of our r ecommendations, and has inf ormation about 
prescribing medicines (including off -label use), pr ofessional guidelines, standar ds 
and laws (including on consent and mental capacity), and saf eguar ding. 
1.1 D iagnosis and assessmen t 
Imag ing assessmen t 
1.1.1 Assess t he pr esence and e xtent of visceral metastases using a combination of 
plain radiograph y, ultrasound, comput ed tomograph y (CT) scans and magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI). [2009]

evidence of bone metastases elsewher e, using bone scintigraph y and/or plain 
radiograph y. [2009] 
1.1.4 Use MRI t o assess bon y metastases if ot her imaging is equiv ocal f or metastatic 
disease or if mor e information is needed (f or example, if t here are lytic 
metastases encr oaching on t he spinal canal). [2009]

cancer f or whom a gr eater pr obability of r esponse is impor tant and who 
understand and ar e likely to tolerat e the additional t oxicity . [2009] 
1.3.10 For patient s wit h adv anced br east cancer who ar e not suitable f or ant hracy clines 
(because t hey are contraindicat ed or because of prior ant hracy cline tr eatment

recommendations: 
• 'Assessment and discussion of patient s' needs f or ph ysical, psy chological, 
social, spiritual and financial suppor t should be under taken at k ey point s 
(such as diagnosis; at commencement, during, and at t he end of tr eatment; 
at relapse; and when deat h is appr oaching). '

Recommenda tions f or research 
The 2014 and 2009 guideline committ ees made t he following r ecommendations f or 
resear ch. 
1 Assessmen t of the r ole of exercise 
What is t he role of arm and shoulder specific e xercises compar ed wit h and/or used as an 
adjunct t o established lymphoedema tr eatment s (such as compr ession garment s and 
comple x decongestiv e therap y)? 
Why this is im portant 
Well-designed randomised contr olled trials should consider diff ering arm and shoulder -
specific aer obic and/or r esistiv e exercises t hat f ocus on str engt h and fle xibility t o impr ove 
local lymph flo w, for example, swimming, w eight lifting, tai chi and y oga. The studies 
should ha ve a follow-up period t hat is sufficient t o captur e long-t erm out comes including 
changes t o curr ent lymphoedema or an y new-onset lymphoedema in ot her par ts of t he 
limb. Out comes f or this resear ch should include quality-of -life measur es. [2014] 
2 Endocrine ther apy 
Clinical trials ar e needed t o investigat e the most eff ectiv e endocrine t herap y for 
postmenopausal w omen wit h ER-positiv e tumours who pr ogress on tr eatment wit h an 
aromatase inhibit or. 
Why this is im portant 
Although t here is good e vidence t o suppor t the use of ar omatase inhibit ors f or 
postmenopausal w omen wit h ER-positiv e tumours, t here is litt le evidence t o det ermine 
what is t he best sequence of alt ernativ e hormone tr eatment s when t hey progress. [2009] 
3 Chemother apy 
Randomised clinical trials should e valuat e the clinical and cost eff ectiv eness of diff erent Advanced br east cancer: diagnosis and tr eatment (CG81)

sequences of chemot herap y for adv anced br east cancer . 
Why this is im portant 
Most patient s wit h adv anced br east cancer who r eceiv e chemot herap y will be giv en at 
least tw o diff erent r egimens and man y will r eceiv e three. The a vailable e vidence t o 
suppor t decisions about t he most clinically and cost eff ectiv e sequence in which t o use 
these drugs is e xtremely limit ed. Ther e is also v ery little good-quality e vidence about t he 
relativ e clinical and cost eff ectiv eness of curr ently recommended tr eatment s, eit her in 
combination or in sequence. F ollowing on fr om t he recommendations in t his guideline, it 
would be impor tant t o establish clinical trials t o investigat e this pr oblem in a mor e 
systematic f ashion t han hit herto. [2009] 
4 Biological response modifier s (pr ogressive 
metasta tic dise ase) 
The use of continued trastuzumab in patient s wit h progressiv e metastatic disease should 
be in vestigat ed as par t of a randomised contr olled trial. T rial design should incorporat e 
collection of data r equir ed for pr ospectiv e cost -effectiv eness analysis. 
Why this is im portant 
Ther e is curr ently no high-quality published e vidence about whet her continuing 
trastuzumab is eff ectiv e in pr olonging sur vival in patient s wit h HER2-positiv e adv anced 
breast cancer who de velop pr ogressiv e disease ( outside t he central ner vous syst em) 
during or aft er first -line tr eatment wit h trastuzumab and cyt otoxic chemot herap y. Any 
studies should be car efully planned t o permit a high quality cost -effectiv eness analysis. 
[2009] 
5 Biological response modifier s (adjuvant 
trastuzumab ) 
Randomised contr olled trials ar e needed t o assess whet her patient s who ha ve had 
adjuv ant trastuzumab should be off ered fur ther biological r esponse modifiers. T rial design 
should incorporat e collection of data r equir ed for pr ospectiv e cost -effectiv eness analysis. Advanced br east cancer: diagnosis and tr eatment (CG81)

conditions#notice-of -right s).Page 13
of 17
Why this is im portant 
As mor e patient s wit h HER2-positiv e adv anced br east cancer ha ve trastuzumab as par t of 
their initial adjuv ant tr eatment f ollowing a diagnosis of early br east cancer , an incr easing 
number of patient s wit h adv anced br east cancer will ha ve had pr evious e xposur e to this 
agent. Ther e is no e vidence curr ently about whet her trastuzumab or ot her biological 
therapies ar e eff ectiv e in t his situation. [2009] 
6 Uncontrolled loc al dise ase 
The r elevant r esear ch or ganisations should be encouraged t o addr ess t he topic of 
uncontr olled local disease and de vise appr opriat e resear ch studies. This might include 
development of a national r egist er. 
Why this is im portant 
The pr oblem of ho w best t o manage uncontr olled local disease is v ery poorly addr essed 
by the curr ent e vidence. Alt hough it is pr obably quit e an uncommon condition, it is lik ely 
that acr oss t he countr y there are enough patient s to generat e evidence fr om w ell-
coordinat ed national studies. A national r egist er should be consider ed as par t of t his 
because of t he curr ent uncer tainties about t he fr equency of t he pr oblem. [2009] Advanced br east cancer: diagnosis and tr eatment (CG81)

Context 
Breast cancer is t he most common cancer aff ecting w omen in England and W ales, wit h 
about 40 ,500 new cases diagnosed and 10 ,900 deat hs recorded in England and W ales 
each y ear. In men br east cancer is rar e, wit h about 260 cases diagnosed and 68 deat hs in 
England and W ales each y ear (Office f or National Statistics, Cancer statistics r egistrations: 
registrations of cancer diagnosed in 2005 , England; W elsh Cancer Int elligence and 
Surveillance Unit, Cancer incidence in W ales 1992− 2002). Of t hese new cases in w omen 
and men, a small pr opor tion is diagnosed in t he adv anced stages, when t he tumour has 
spread significant ly wit hin the br east or t o other or gans of t he body . In addition, t here are 
a significant number of w omen who ha ve been pr eviously tr eated wit h curativ e intent who

have been impor tant de velopment s in t he in vestigation and management of patient s wit h 
advanced br east cancer , including new chemot herap y, and biological and hormonal 
agent s. Ther e is some e vidence of practice v ariation acr oss t he countr y and of pat chy 
availability of cer tain tr eatment s and pr ocedur es. This clinical guideline helps t o addr ess 
these issues and off ers guidance on best practice. Advanced br east cancer: diagnosis and tr eatment (CG81)
