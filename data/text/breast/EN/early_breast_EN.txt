Recommenda tions 
People ha ve the right t o be in volved in discussions and mak e informed decisions 
about t heir car e, as described in NICE's inf ormation on making decisions about y our 
care. 
This guideline uses specific, inclusiv e language t o describe t he population gr oups it 
covers (f or example, w omen and pr egnant people, or trans and non-binar y people) 
except when: 
• the evidence f or the recommendation has not been r eview ed and it is not cer tain 
from e xper t opinion whet her it can co ver mor e groups, or 
• the evidence has been r eview ed, but t he inf ormation a vailable f or some gr oups at 
the time of de velopment was t oo limit ed to mak e specific r ecommendations, or 
• only a v ery limit ed number of r ecommendations ha ve been updat ed in dir ect 
response t o new e vidence or t o reflect a change in practice. 
Healt hcare professionals should use t heir clinical judgement when implementing 
gender -specific r ecommendations, taking int o account t he individual's 
circumstances, needs and pr eferences, and ensuring all people ar e treated wit h 
dignity and r espect t hroughout t heir car e. 
Making decisions using NICE guidelines  explains ho w we use w ords to sho w the 
strengt h (or cer tainty) of our r ecommendations, and has inf ormation about 
prescribing medicines (including off -label use), pr ofessional guidelines, standar ds 
and laws (including on consent and mental capacity), and saf eguar ding.

Why the c ommi ttee made the r ecommenda tion 
Ther e was some e vidence t hat t here was a r educed risk of ductal car cinoma in situ (DCIS) 
local r ecurr ence if tissue mar gins w ere greater than 0  mm, so t he committ ee 
recommended fur ther sur gery (re-excision or mast ectomy) to extend t he mar gins if 
needed. Alt hough t here was no consist ent e vidence about tissue mar gins f or invasive 
breast cancer , the committ ee agr eed t hat fur ther sur gery should be off ered. 
The committ ee agr eed t hat complet e excision of t he tumour wit h clear mar gins was 
essential f or the high-quality car e of people wit h DCIS or in vasive breast cancer . 
Ther e was not enough e vidence t o clearly define an optimum mar gin widt h betw een 0  mm 
and 2  mm t o minimise local r ecurr ence rat es and minimise fur ther sur gery. So, t he 
committ ee agr eed t hat t his was an impor tant t opic f or fur ther r esear ch and made a 
recommendation f or resear ch on t he optimum tumour -free mar gin widt h aft er sur gery to 
the br east. 
How the r ecommenda tion mig ht affect practice 
The rat es of fur ther sur gery curr ently vary acr oss t he countr y. Although t he committ ee 
noted that t he recommendation will r einforce curr ent best practice, t here ma y be some 
centr es that will need t o amend t heir practice in or der t o follow this recommendation.

Recommendations 1 .3.2 to 1.3.5 
Why the c ommi ttee made the r ecommenda tions 
The committ ee agr eed t hat t he best choice f or radial mar gin siz e would be a balance 
betw een t he need f or fur ther sur gery (to reduce t he risk of local r ecurr ence and maximise 
overall sur vival) and maintaining good le vels of patient satisf action. This balance also 
needs t o tak e into account t he pot ential harms of fur ther sur gery, and possible need f or 
other tr eatment s to tak e priority o ver fur ther sur gery. Because of t he wa y the evidence 
was r epor ted in t he included studies, t he committ ee discussed t he evidence on radial 
margins aft er br east-conser ving sur gery separat ely for people who had in vasive breast Early and locally adv anced br east cancer: diagnosis and management (NG101)

cancer wit h or wit hout DCIS and f or people who had DCIS only . Most of t he data was f or 
local r ecurr ence, wit h some f or distant r ecurr ence and v ery limit ed data f or overall sur vival 
or br east-cancer -specific sur vival. Ther e was no e vidence on patient -repor ted out comes 
or quality of lif e. Ther efore, the committ ee based most of t heir discussion on t he evidence 
for local r ecurr ence, and used t heir personal and clinical e xperience t o consider t he 
perspectiv es and pr eferences of people who ha ve breast cancer . 
The committ ee discussions f ocused on whet her a radial mar gin of 1  mm or 2  mm should be 
the cut -off f or fur ther sur gery. The committ ee agr eed t hat when t he tumour is at 0  mm, 
this balance is str ongly in f avour of fur ther sur gery to try to ensur e the full tumour is 
removed, so t he existing r ecommendation t o off er fur ther sur gery was r etained wit hout 
reviewing t he evidence. F or people wit h invasive breast cancer wit h or wit hout DCIS, t he 
evidence sho wed that t he risk of local r ecurr ence was higher wit h radial mar gins of gr eater 
than 0  mm t o less t han 1  mm compar ed wit h greater than or equal t o 1 mm. This was also 
the case f or local r ecurr ence when radial mar gins of gr eater than 0  mm t o 2 mm w ere 
compar ed wit h greater than 2  mm. Ho wever, the evidence could not diff erentiat e betw een 
greater than 1  mm t o 2 mm compar ed wit h greater than 2  mm. The committ ee also not ed 
that t he incidence of local r ecurr ence has decr eased because of adv ances in br east 
cancer car e. 
Taking t his int o account wit h the evidence f or local r ecurr ence, t he committ ee did not 
think t hat r ecommending a mar gin of 1  mm, rat her t han 2  mm, w ould lead t o a substantially 
increased risk of local r ecurr ence. Additionally , they agr eed t hat f or man y people, a mar gin 
of 1 mm is lik ely to be pr eferable o ver a mor e cautious appr oach wit h a mar gin of 2  mm 
because t he smaller mar gin is lik ely to achie ve bett er br east pr eservation and r esult in 
fewer additional sur geries. The y not ed that r epeat ed sur geries negativ ely aff ect br east 
appearance, and t his can ha ve a negativ e eff ect on t he person's self -esteem and view of 
themselv es. The y are also traumatic f or the person in volved and can lead t o str ess, 
infections, pain, complications associat ed wit h recovery from t he anaest hetic and 
operation, and negativ ely aff ect t heir e veryday life. As a r esult, t he committ ee agr eed t hat 
further sur gery should be consider ed for people who had br east-conser ving sur gery for 
invasive breast cancer wit h or wit hout DCIS if tumour cells ar e present wit hin 1  mm of t he 
radial mar gins. 
For DCIS only , the limit ed evidence was of moderat e to very low quality , and t he 
committ ee was not confident of t he diff erences in eff ect betw een a mar gin of less t han, or 
greater than, 2  mm on local r ecurr ence. As a r esult, t hey decided t o retain t he threshold of 
2 mm fr om t he existing r ecommendation when considering fur ther sur gery for this Early and locally adv anced br east cancer: diagnosis and management (NG101)

population. The committ ee did not mak e a recommendation f or resear ch for this gr oup 
because t hey were awar e of new studies alr eady under way that could inf orm t his decision 
in the futur e. 
As w ell as t hinking about t he pot ential clinical benefit s of fur ther sur gery, the committ ee 
ackno wledged t he impor tance of taking t he person's cir cumstances, needs and 
preferences int o account as par t of t he decision-making pr ocess. This is int ended t o help 
ensur e that an y barriers t o par ticular tr eatment options ar e consider ed and addr essed 
wher e possible. The y recommended t hat t here should be a discussion wit h the person 
about t he benefit s of sur gery, such as r educing t he risk of r ecurr ence, as w ell as risks, 
such as inf ection and complications. The committ ee also agr eed ot her clinical f actors, 
such as tumour charact eristics and pot ential tr eatment s, should be tak en int o account. 
They referred to the NICE guidelines on shar ed decision making  and patient e xperience  to 
help inf orm t hese discussions. 
The committ ee not ed that, in t heir e xperience, t he existing r ecommendation about 
auditing r ecurr ence is not unif ormly applied and t hat t he inf ormation r ecorded does not 
necessarily include t he radial mar gin. The y therefore expanded t he recommendation t o 
highlight f actors t hat t hey thought should be r ecorded in addition t o recurr ence. The 
committ ee was also awar e of a new National Audit of Primar y Breast Cancer  that ma y 
improve recording of t his inf ormation. 
The committ ee not ed that t here was no e vidence f or people r eceiving neoadjuv ant 
hormone t herap y or biological tr eatment s and v ery little evidence f or people r eceiving 
neoadjuv ant chemot herap y, and t hat t he quality of t his e vidence was v ery low. Ther efore, 
they could not mak e a specific r ecommendation f or this gr oup. Ho wever, they agr eed t hat 
the evidence f or people who did not ha ve neoadjuv ant t herap y could be e xtrapolat ed to 
this gr oup and t hat t he recommendation f or people wit h invasive breast cancer wit h or 
without DCIS could apply t o them as w ell. 
How the r ecommenda tions mig ht affect practice 
It is not e xpect ed that t he recommendation f or people wit h invasive breast cancer will 
increase r esour ce use since it is lik ely that f ewer people will ha ve fur ther sur gery giv en the 
reduction in mar gin siz e. The r ecommendations should also encourage standar disation of 
practice in r elation t o radial mar gins f or invasive breast cancer wit h or wit hout DCIS acr oss 
the UK. The r ecommendations f or DCIS r etain t he existing radial mar gins and ar e therefore 
not e xpect ed to change practice or r esour ce use. Early and locally adv anced br east cancer: diagnosis and management (NG101)

Context 
This guideline updat es and r eplaces t he NICE guideline on early and locally adv anced 
breast cancer (CG80). This is because new e vidence was identified in sur veillance t hat 
could aff ect r ecommendations, and has alr eady changed clinical practice in some 
locations. 
People wit h sympt oms t hat could be caused b y breast cancer ar e referred by their GP t o 
designat ed br east clinics in local hospitals (see NICE's guideline on suspect ed cancer: 
recognition and r eferral ). In addition, eligible w omen ar e invited for scr eening t hrough t he 
NHS Br east Scr eening Pr ogramme (NHSBSP) in England or t he Br east T est W ales 
Screening Pr ogramme (BTWSP) in W ales. F or most people, whet her t hey are referred 
following br east scr eening or aft er pr esentation t o a GP , diagnosis in t he br east clinic is 
made b y triple assessment ( clinical assessment, mammograph y and/or ultrasound 
imaging, and cor e biopsy and/or fine-needle aspiration cyt ology). It is best practice t o 
carry out t hese assessment s at t he same visit (see NICE's cancer ser vice guideline on 
improving out comes in br east cancer ). 
Breast cancer is t he most common cancer in t he UK, wit h appr oximat ely 54 ,000 new 
cases of in vasive disease and ar ound 7 ,000 new cases of pr e-invasive (in situ) disease 
diagnosed annually . Most of t he br east cancers occur in w omen, but just o ver 300 men in 
the UK ar e also diagnosed wit h invasive breast cancer e very year. 
Most br east cancers ar e diagnosed at an early stage and ar e therefore pot entially curable 
with modern tr eatment s. Sur vival rat es ha ve impr oved over recent decades wit h almost 
90% of w omen diagnosed wit h breast cancer sur viving t heir disease f or 5 or mor e years 
after diagnosis. Sur vival is, ho wever, link ed to the stage of t he disease at diagnosis; only 
15% of w omen diagnosed wit h stage  IV disease ar e aliv e at 5  years. Br east cancer r emains 
the leading cause of deat h in w omen aged 35 t o 49  years and is second only t o lung 
cancer as t he leading cause of cancer deat h in all w omen. 
The main risk f actor for br east cancer is being f emale; t he disease is 100 times less 
common in men. It is also a disease of ageing, wit h the risk of br east cancer incr easing 
with incr easing age. Some br east cancers ar e link ed to lifestyle f actors t hat include 
obesity , alcohol intak e and use of hormone r eplacement t herap y, wher eas ot her lif estyle 
factors, including ph ysical activity and br eastf eeding, pr otect against br east cancer . About 
5% of br east cancers ar e because of inherit ed mutations in high-risk genes such as Early and locally adv anced br east cancer: diagnosis and management (NG101)
