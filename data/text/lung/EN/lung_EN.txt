Diagnosis and stag ing 
Why the c ommi ttee made the r ecommenda tions 
Effectiv eness of diagnostic and staging in vestigations 
Recommendation 1 .3.10 
Clinical audit is an impor tant t ool for maintaining high standar ds in t he use of 
endobr onchial ultrasound-guided transbr onchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) and 
endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA). This is consist ent wit h 
the British Thoracic Society guideline  and quality standar ds (which ar e accr edited by 
NICE). 
EBUS-TBNA and EUS-FNA 
Recommendations 1 .3.19 to 1.3.21 
The r ecommendations co ver: 
• initial in vasive investigations f or people wit h an int ermediat e probability of mediastinal 
malignancy 
• subsequent in vestigations f or people wit h a high pr obability of mediastinal malignancy , 
when neck ultrasound and biopsy ar e negativ e. 
In these cir cumstances, when compar ed wit h alternativ e investigations, EBUS-TBNA and 
EUS-FNA: 
• produce a diagnosis and stage f aster than br onchoscop y or CT -guided biopsy Lung cancer: diagnosis and management (NG122)
© NICE 202 4. All right s reserved. Subject t o Notice of right s (https://www .nice.or g.uk/t erms-and-
conditions#notice-of -right s).Page 37
of 51
• are mor e acceptable t o patient s than sur gery 
• reduce t he need f or fur ther in vestigations and hospital visit s compar ed wit h 
bronchoscop y. 
Surgical mediastinal staging 
Recommendation 1 .3.21 
Ther e is e vidence t hat sur gical staging is useful when EBUS-TBNA and/or EUS-FNA ar e 
negativ e but clinical suspicion of mediastinal malignancy is high. While t here are pot ential 
harms fr om t he in vasive natur e of sur gical staging, t here is no e vidence t hat t hese 
outw eigh t he benefit s in t his population. 
Procedur es that w ere not r ecommended 
Transt horacic needle biopsy , bronchoscop y and non-ultrasound-guided TBNA ar e no 
longer r ecommended f or staging lung cancer in intrat horacic lymph nodes because: 
• bronchoscop y and non-ultrasound-guided TBNA ar e unlik ely to reach t he minimum 
sensitivity r equir ed by the British Thoracic quality standar ds and 
• they ma y discourage people fr om ha ving mor e eff ectiv e procedur es (such as EBUS-
TBNA) and subsequent in vestigations. 
The w ord 'fibr eoptic' has been r emoved because br onchoscop y can be fibr eoptic, video or 
hybrid. 
How the r ecommenda tions mig ht affect practice 
The r ecommendations on PET -CT r eflect curr ent practice, so will not incur an e xtra cost. 
The r ecommendations on EBUS-TBNA and EUS-FNA will r einforce best practice and r esult 
in a mor e streamlined diagnostic ser vice wit h mor e timely diagnosis and staging. 
The sur gical mediastinal staging r ecommendation will also r einforce best practice and 
restrict t his pr ocedur e to people most lik ely to benefit.

Brain imag ing f or pe ople ha ving tr eatmen t with 
curative intent 
Recommendations 1 .3.23 t o 1.3.25 
Why the c ommi ttee made the r ecommenda tions 
Brain imaging is helpful bef ore star ting tr eatment wit h curativ e intent, because if brain 
metastases ar e det ected then t he tr eatment plan is lik ely to change. Ho wever, routine 
brain imaging is e xpensiv e, and t he evidence sho wed that it does not alwa ys off er a good 
balance of benefit s and cost s. 
In people wit h stage  II and IIIA disease, t he benefit s of brain imaging outw eigh t he cost s 
because: 
• brain metastases ar e mor e common t han in stage  I disease 
• people can star t early tr eatment f or metastases if t hey are identified, which impr oves 
prognosis 
• some people wit h brain metastases will not ha ve radical tr eatment ( depending on 
factors such as t he number of metastases, pr ognosis and patient pr eference), and t his 
reduces cost s. 
In people wit h clinical stage  I NSCL C and no neur ological sympt oms, t he pr evalence of 
detectable brain metastases is f airly lo w (ar ound 4%) compar ed wit h people wit h stage  II 
or IIIA disease. P eople wit h stage  I NSCL C who do ha ve brain metastases oft en still ha ve 
radical lung tr eatment, which is much mor e rar ely the case f or people wit h stage  IIIA 
NSCL C. Ov erall, t he lo wer pr evalence of metastases and smaller r eduction in numbers of 
people ha ving radical tr eatment mean t hat t he benefit s of brain imaging in t his population 
are too lo w to justify t he cost s. 
The 2018 r eview only e xamined t he clinical and cost eff ectiv eness of imaging aft er the 
treatment plan has been decided, but t he committ ee not ed that it could be mor e efficient 
to conduct CT brain imaging alongside initial staging CT . Wit h this in mind, t he committ ee 
made a recommendation f or resear ch on r outine brain imaging wit h CT  at initial diagnosis 
and/or staging. Lung cancer: diagnosis and management (NG122)

of 51
How the r ecommenda tions mig ht affect practice 
Practice in t his ar ea is v ariable. The committ ee estimat ed that t he recommendations will 
increase t he number of people who ha ve brain imaging. In turn, t hey thought t his should 
prevent t he use of tr eatment options (such as lobect omy and sublobar r esection) in some 
patient s for whom it is not e xpect ed to be beneficial. The r ecommendations ma y also lead 
to an incr ease in radical radiot herap y, stereotactic radiosur gery and brain sur gery. These 
treatment s would be e xpect ed to impr ove the person's pr ognosis, alt hough each 
treatment w ould carr y its own risks and side eff ects.

Surgery and r adiother apy with cur ative intent for 
non-small -cell lung c ancer 
Recommendations 1 .6.1 and 1 .6.5 to 1.6.12 
Why the c ommi ttee made the r ecommenda tions 
For people wit h non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCL C) who ar e well enough and f or whom 
treatment wit h curativ e intent is suitable, t he evidence sho wed that lobect omy provides 
better sur vival out comes t han st ereotactic ablativ e radiot herap y (SABR). Lobect omy is a 
good compr omise betw een pr eserving pulmonar y function and being mor e likely to 
remove cancer ous cells compar ed wit h sublobar r esection. 
For people wit h stage  I–IIA (T1a–T2b, N0 , M0) NSCL C, the evidence sho wed that: 
• if they decline lobect omy or it is contraindicat ed, sublobar r esection and SABR bot h 
provide bett er sur vival out comes t han con ventionally fractionat ed radiot herap y, 
although it is not clear which of t hese 2 is bett er 
• if they decline an y sur gery or it is contraindicat ed, SABR pr ovides bett er sur vival 
outcomes t han con ventionally fractionat ed radiot herap y, and people oft en pr efer it 
because it in volves fewer hospital visit s 
• if sur gery and SABR ar e contraindicat ed, con ventionally fractionat ed radiot herap y 
provides bett er sur vival out comes t han no radiot herap y. Lung cancer: diagnosis and management (NG122)

conditions#notice-of -right s).Page 40
of 51
For people wit h stage  IIIA or IIIB NSCL C who cannot t olerat e chemoradiot herap y or who 
decline it, t he evidence was not str ong enough t o recommend con ventional radiot herap y 
over hyper-fractionat ed regimens or vice v ersa. Ho wever, people who cannot t olerat e 
chemoradiot herap y ma y also be unable t o tolerat e radical radiot herap y, so t his will not be 
an option f or everyone wit h stage IIIA or IIIB NSCL C. For an e xplanation of t he 
recommendations co vering sur gery in t his gr oup, see t he rationale on management of 
stage IIIA-N2 NSCL C. 
55 Gy in 20  fractions is t he most common con ventional radical radiot herap y regimen in t he 
UK. If con ventionally fractionat ed radiot herap y is used, a t otal radiation dose of 60  Gy 
provides bett er sur vival out comes and f ewer adv erse e vents than 7 4 Gy. A total dose of 
60 to 66  Gy is also normal NHS practice. 
Ther e are not man y randomised contr olled trials comparing SABR wit h sur gery (lobect omy 
or sublobar r esection). SABR is non-in vasive, so if it is as eff ectiv e as sur gery then it ma y 
be a pr eferable option f or man y people wit h lung cancer . Ther e are also v arious f actors 
that ma y mak e SABR less cost ly than sur gery. For example, it is usually deliv ered as 
outpatient tr eatment. Ther e might also be subgr oups f or whom diff erent f orms of sur gery 
or SABR might be t he most cost -effectiv e options. The committ ee made a 
recommendation f or resear ch on SABR compar ed wit h sur gery to investigat e these 
uncer tainties. 
How the r ecommenda tions mig ht affect practice 
The new r ecommendations on SABR ar e a change fr om t he 2011 guideline and impr ove 
choice f or people wit h NSCL C. Ho wever, practice has also changed since 2011 , and SABR 
is no w widely used, so implementing t he recommendations ma y not in volve a significant 
change in practice. The r emaining changes t o the recommendations r eflect curr ent 
practice.

Why the c ommi ttee made the r ecommenda tions 
The a vailable e vidence sho wed that chemoradiot herap y and sur gery are mor e eff ectiv e 
than chemoradiot herap y alone in people who ar e well enough f or sur gery and when t he 
disease is operable. F or chemot herap y and sur gery, there was no e vidence t hat sur vival 
outcomes w ere bett er than f or chemoradiot herap y, so t he additional cost s of including 
surgery outw eighed t he benefit s. 
The k ey benefit associat ed wit h chemoradiot herap y and sur gery is t he longer 
progression-fr ee sur vival time. An analysis of multiple trials sho wed impr oved pr ogression-
free sur vival and cost eff ectiv eness f or chemoradiot herap y wit h sur gery, compar ed wit h 
chemoradiot herap y alone. Ther e was an 89% pr obability t hat chemoradiot herap y and 
surgery impr oved average o verall sur vival time compar ed wit h chemoradiot herap y. 
However, the evidence in f avour of chemoradiot herap y and sur gery involved indir ect 
comparisons, and no head-t o-head trials sho wed meaningful diff erences in o verall sur vival 
for an y of t he int erventions. And as wit h any major sur gery, there is a perioperativ e 
mortality risk f or people who ha ve chemoradiot herap y and sur gery. 
The 3  to 5 week wait f or sur gery is r ecommended t o giv e people time t o recover from t he 
chemoradiot herap y. 
Chemoradiot herap y wit h sur gery is not oft en off ered in curr ent practice. In addition, t here 
are specific f actors t o tak e into account when off ering all t hese tr eatment s toget her. 
Ther efore, multidisciplinar y teams pr oviding it should ha ve exper tise bot h in t he combined 
therap y, and in all t he individual component s. 
Immunot herap y has been sho wn to be eff ectiv e in a v ariety of NSCL C indications but t here 
is curr ently no e vidence on whet her it is clinically or cost eff ectiv e for people wit h stage 
IIIA-N2 NSCL C following sur gery. The committ ee made a recommendation f or resear ch on 
immunot herap y aft er multimodality tr eatment  to addr ess t his. 
How the r ecommenda tions mig ht affect practice 
The committ ee felt that chemoradiot herap y and sur gery is off ered far less oft en than 
chemoradiot herap y alone or chemot herap y and sur gery for people wit h NSCL C stage IIIA-
N2. Ther efore, these r ecommendations could lead t o a change in curr ent practice.

Recommendations 1 .10.1 to 1.10.5 
Why the c ommi ttee chang ed the r ecommenda tions 
The e vidence sho wed a sur vival benefit fr om twice-daily radiot herap y compar ed wit h 
once-daily . However, the committ ee agr eed t hat some people wit h small-cell lung cancer 
will not be w ell enough t o tolerat e twice-daily radiot herap y, so t hey recommended giving 
people t he option of once-daily radiot herap y. 
The committ ee not ed that, in practice, radiot herap y is not star ted in chemot herap y cycle 1, 
because t his is when planning f or the radiot herap y oft en tak es place (see t he 
recommendation on twice-daily radiot herap y wit h concurr ent chemot herap y in t he section 
on first -line tr eatment f or limit ed-stage disease small-cell lung cancer ). Ho wever, there 
was no new e vidence on when t o star t radiot herap y, so t he 2019 r ecommendation on t his

Ther e were limit ed data a vailable on whet her continuous radiot herap y wit h concurr ent

The e vidence sho wed that pr ophylactic cranial irradiation impr oves sur vival versus best 
suppor tive car e. 
Prophylactic cranial irradiation can adv ersely aff ect quality of lif e, and t he sur vival benefit s 
are limit ed. Ther e is also some e vidence fr om a study out side t he UK t hat r outine MRI

resear ch on pr ophylactic cranial irradiation compar ed wit h routine MRI f ollow-up in 
extensiv e-stage SCL C, to provide e vidence mor e relevant t o the UK and t o see if MRI 
could identify people who need whole-brain radiot herap y and so r educe t he number of 
people ha ving unnecessar y treatment.

Context 
Over 46 ,000 people w ere diagnosed wit h lung cancer in t he UK in 2015 . An estimat ed 89% 
of lung cancers ar e preventable, wit h 86% of t hese link ed to smoking, 13% t o occupational 
exposur e, 9% t o dietar y factors and 7 .8% to air pollution. Lung cancer can be link ed to 
more than one  cause. 
In 2015 in t he UK, o ver 35 ,000 people died fr om lung cancer . The o verall mor tality rat e 
from lung cancer has decr eased b y 9% o ver the last decade. Ho wever, while t here has 
been a decr ease of 19% in mor tality rat es in men, t here has been an incr ease of 2% in 
women. This is link ed to lifestyle f actors such as smoking and is driv en by an incr eased 
incidence of lung cancer in older w omen. 
In the UK, lung cancer is mor e common in people of Eur opean f amily origin t han in people 
of African or Asian f amily origin. It is str ongly link ed to socioeconomic depriv ation. Ther e 
are man y risk f actors f or lung cancer , including age, genetics, lif estyle ( especially smoking) 
and occupation. Lung cancer is estimat ed to cost t he UK econom y £2.4  billion per y ear. 
Note: all statistics in t his section ar e from Cancer R esear ch UK's Lung Cancer Statistics . 
Curr ent practice 
Lung cancer is diagnosed and staged using a v ariety of t ests, including chest X -rays, CT or 
positr on-emission t omograph y CT (PET -CT). Lung cancer samples ar e commonly acquir ed 
for diagnosis using br onchoscop y, endobr onchial ultrasound (EBUS) or a per cutaneous 
procedur e (guided b y CT or ultrasound). 
Lung cancer has 2 main types: 
• non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCL C), which is mor e common and spr eads mor e slo wly 
• small-cell lung cancer (SCL C), which is rar er and spr eads mor e quickly . 
Treatment depends on t he type, siz e, position and stage of t he cancer , and t he person's 
healt h. Possible tr eatment s include radiot herap y, syst emic anti-cancer t herapies, sur gery, 
suppor tive car e cryotherap y, phot odynamic t herap y and ablation. Lung cancer: diagnosis and management (NG122)

Since 2011 , when t he NICE lung cancer guideline was last updat ed, t here have been 
changes in t he wa y that lung cancer is diagnosed and tr eated. The R oyal College of 
Physicians' National Lung Cancer Audit annual r epor t 2016 identified t hat only 72% of 
people ha ve pat hological confirmation of t heir lung cancer . Ther e is also inconsist ency in 
the availability of molecular t esting in lung cancer diagnosis. 
NHS England has tak en st eps t o shor ten the time t o treatment, as w ell as impr ove access 
to and uptak e of radiot herap y, and st ereotactic ablativ e radiot herap y (SABR) is r outinely 
used f or cer tain subgr oups of people wit h early-stage NSCL C. Ther e are now a v ariety of 
licensed immunot herapies and biological tar geted therapies f or treating adv anced NSCL C, 
and NICE has published t echnology appraisals co vering man y of t hese. Lung cancer: diagnosis and management (NG122)
