Context 
Pancr eatic cancer is t he fift h most common cause of cancer deat h in t he UK, wit h an 
annual incidence of nearly  9,600. On a verage, 23  people die each da y from t he disease. 
The UK has one of t he w orst sur vival rat es in Eur ope, wit h average lif e expectancy on 
diagnosis just 4  to 6 mont hs and a r elativ e sur vival to 1 year of appr oximat ely 20%. 
Only 3% of people sur vive for 5 years or longer . This figur e has not impr oved much in o ver 
40 years, and it is not y et clear ho w the mor e recent tr end of incr eased sur gery and 
adjuv ant chemot herap y will aff ect sur vival. 
Because of lat e diagnosis, only appr oximat ely 8% of people wit h pancr eatic cancer ar e 
eligible f or pot entially curativ e sur gery. However, people ha ve up t o a 30% chance of 
surviving 5  years if t heir tumour can be sur gically r emoved and t hey have adjuv ant 
chemot herap y. 
The sympt oms of pancr eatic cancer ar e non-specific. One sur vey found t hat 40% of 
people diagnosed wit h pancr eatic cancer in England had visit ed their GP 3  or mor e times 
before the diagnosis was made. Fifty per cent of people ar e diagnosed as an emer gency in 
A&E. Ev en aft er diagnosis, t here is e vidence fr om t he National Cancer Int elligence Netw ork 
of wide v ariation in practice t hroughout England. 
Ther e are oft en dela ys in access t o diagnosis and tr eatment (as highlight ed in t he NHS 
England Fiv e Year F orward View ), and t his guideline will help t o impr ove this. Pancr eatic cancer in adult s: diagnosis and management (NG85)

Recommenda tions f or research 
The guideline committ ee has made t he following r ecommendations f or resear ch. The 
committ ee's full set of r ecommendations f or resear ch ar e detailed in t he full guideline . 
1 Neoadjuvant ther apy 
Prospectiv e randomised trials should be under taken to compar e preoperativ e 
(neoadjuv ant) t herap y wit h standar d post operativ e therap y in people wit h resectable 
pancr eatic cancer . 
Why this is im portant 
The sur vival rat e of pancr eatic cancer aft er sur gical r esection is v ery low, which suggest s 
that most patient s have metastatic disease at t he time of sur gery. In addition, 
complications of sur gery ma y stop people fr om ha ving adjuv ant t herap y. This mak es 
neoadjuv ant t herap y an attractiv e option. Ho wever, the evidence f or neoadjuv ant t herap y 
is limit ed and lo w quality . Using neoadjuv ant t herap y means dela ying sur gery, and it is 
possible t hat during t his dela y pancr eatic cancer will pr ogress and become unr esectable in 
some people, negating an y benefit of neoadjuv ant t herap y. 
Resear ch is needed t o compar e neoadjuv ant tr eatment s (which might be chemot herap y,

2 Cache xia in terventions 
A cohor t study f ollowed by phase  2 and  3 studies should be under taken in people wit h 
pancr eatic cancer and cache xia or pr e-cache xia, t o compar e cache xia assessment 
methods and anti-cache xia int erventions wit h standar d car e. 
Why this is im portant 
Most people wit h adv anced and metastatic pancr eatic cancer also ha ve cache xia. This 
causes se vere reductions in t heir quality of lif e and is associat ed wit h reduced o verall 
survival. Cache xia has 3  phases: pr e-cache xia, cache xia and r efract ory cache xia. The 
condition cannot be st opped b y con ventional nutritional suppor t and leads t o progressiv e 
functional impairment. Complet e or par tial reversal of cache xia w ould cause major 
improvement s in quality of lif e, and pot entially impr ove sur vival if people r ecover enough t o 
have mor e eff ectiv e cancer tr eatment s. The out comes of int erest ar e: 
• prevention or r eversal of cache xia 
• overall sur vival 
• quality of lif e 
• pain r elief 
• lean tissue mass 
• tolerance t o treatment. 
3 Minimall y invasive pancr eatectomy 
Prospectiv e randomised trials should be under taken to compar e the eff ectiv eness of 
minimally in vasive pancr eatectomy or pancr eatoduodenect omy (lapar oscopic or r obotic) 
with open pancr eatectomy or pancr eatoduodenect omy in people wit h pancr eatic cancer . 
Why this is im portant 
Minimally in vasive sur gery is generally consider ed to be mor e acceptable t o patient s than Pancr eatic cancer in adult s: diagnosis and management (NG85)

open sur gery. It has been intr oduced successfully f or se veral ot her types of cancer and 
has been sho wn to impr ove quality of lif e. Ho wever, there is not enough e vidence t o 
determine whet her minimally in vasive sur gery impr oves morbidity and mor tality f or people 
with pancr eatic cancer , compar ed wit h open sur gery. Prospectiv e randomised trials ar e 
therefore needed in t his ar ea. The out comes of int erest ar e: 
• conversion rat e to open sur gery 
• R0 resection rat e 
• lymph node yield 
• blood loss 
• duration of sur gery 
• complications 
• need f or critical car e 
• lengt h of hospital sta y 
• time t o return t o normal activity 
• mortality of sur gery 
• long-t erm sur vival aft er sur gery 
• quality of lif e, patient e xperience and patient -repor ted out come measur es. 
4 Pain manag emen t 
A randomised trial should be under taken comparing early endoscopic ultrasound-guided 
neurolytic coeliac ple xus (EUS-guided NCP) int erventions wit h on-demand EUS-guided 
NCP int erventions in people wit h unr esectable pancr eatic cancer . 
Why this is im portant 
Ther e is a limit ed number of randomised trials in t his ar ea, and t he met hods used t o 
perform NCP int ervention ar e het erogeneous. It is not clear if early NCP int ervention is 
superior t o on-demand NCP int ervention in t erms of t he impor tant out comes f or the Pancr eatic cancer in adult s: diagnosis and management (NG85)

patient and duration of eff ect of t he pr ocedur e. On-demand NCP int ervention ma y benefit 
people wit h uncontr olled pain, people r eceiving escalating doses of analgesia, people 
experiencing unacceptable analgesic side eff ects, and ot hers. Ho wever, people who 
receiv e early NCP int ervention ma y not need on-demand NCP int ervention lat er on. 
Further r esear ch should clarify if t he timing of t he int ervention conf ers an y adv antage. The 
outcomes of int erest ar e: 
• reduction in pain 
• patient e xperience (including nutritional status) 
• healt h-related quality of lif e 
• adverse e vents 
• analgesic use 
• survival. 
5 Psychological suppor t needs 
A qualitativ e study should be under taken to evaluat e information and suppor t 
interventions t o addr ess psy chological needs at diff erent point s in t he car e pat hway for 
people wit h pancr eatic cancer . 
Why this is im portant 
People wit h pancr eatic cancer oft en ha ve unmet psy chological suppor t needs t hat impact 
on their quality of lif e. These can be r elated to anxiety and depr ession, and t o the 
psychological impact of f atigue, pain, gastr ointestinal sympt oms (par ticularly changes t o 
appetit e) and nutritional status. Ther e has been v ery little resear ch int o the inf ormation 
and suppor t interventions t hat w ould meet t hese needs. R esear ch w ould help identify 
effectiv e information and suppor t interventions t hat w ould impr ove quality of lif e for 
people wit h pancr eatic cancer and t heir f amily members or car ers. Out comes of int erest 
are: 
• quality of lif e 
• psychological w ellbeing Pancr eatic cancer in adult s: diagnosis and management (NG85)
