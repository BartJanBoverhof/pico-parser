Rationale and im pact 
These sections briefly e xplain wh y the committ ee made t he recommendations and ho w 
they might aff ect practice. 
Informa tion and suppor t 
Recommendations 1 .1.1 to 1.1.10 
Why the c ommi ttee made the r ecommenda tions 
The committ ee agr eed t hat t he NICE guidelines on patient e xperience in adult NHS 
services  and shared decision making  give impor tant advice on enabling people t o 
participat e in t heir car e. 
The committ ee agr eed t hat it is impor tant t o giv e information on what t o expect wit h 
investigations and tr eatment s, and t o deliv er it at an appr opriat e time t o suppor t people in 
managing t heir condition. The committ ee w ere awar e that people oft en look f or 
information t hemselv es and t herefore it is impor tant t o direct t hem t o sour ces t hat ar e 
good quality and r eliable. 
The committ ee also agr eed it is impor tant t o explain t o people wit h signs of t hyroid cancer 
that not all sw ellings ar e cancer ous and what an y investigations ma y entail. This included 
the implications of sur gery on t hyroid function and what t he consequences ar e. 
Evidence sho wed that t elling people wit h thyroid cancer t hat it is a 'good cancer' , was 
generally not r eassuring. It caused t hem t o feel that t he diagnosis was being dismissed as 
unimpor tant and, as a r esult, t hey felt undeser ving of seeking suppor t. Ther efore, the 
committ ee recommended t hat healt hcare professionals should a void telling people t hey 
have a 'good cancer' . Inst ead, t hey should giv e the person time t o ackno wledge t hey have 
cancer and t o ask an y questions. F or some people t his ma y mean fur ther appointment s are 
beneficial. 
The committ ee agr eed t hat a lot of people wit h newly diagnosed t hyroid cancer might not 
know what t he thyroid gland does. Ther efore, it is impor tant t o giv e them inf ormation on 
the thyroid gland, ho w their condition will be managed, an y consequences of tr eatment Thyroid cancer: assessment and management (NG230)

and t he long-t erm f ollow-up r equir ement s. 
How the r ecommenda tions mig ht affect practice 
Giving people inf ormation and suppor t and including fur ther appointment s for some 
people, is curr ent practice. Ther efore, the recommendations ar e unlik ely to have a big 
impact. 
Return t o recommendations 
Blood tests 
Recommendations 1 .2.2 t o 1.2.5 
Why the c ommi ttee made the r ecommenda tions 
The v ery early par t of t he pat hway for suspect ed thyroid cancer is co vered in ot her NICE 
guidance. NICE's guideline on suspect ed cancer co vers when t o refer people wit h an 
unexplained t hyroid lump and NICE's guideline on t hyroid disease co vers t he initial t ests to 
use when in vestigating suspect ed thyroid dysfunction or t hyroid enlar gement. F or this 
guideline, t he committ ee look ed at additional blood t ests that could be used f or the 
diagnosis of t hyroid cancer . The committ ee made r ecommendations in t his ar ea based on 
consensus because no e vidence was identified. 
Calcit onin t esting 
The committ ee discussed t he high rat e of f alse positiv es from calcit onin t esting, which can 
cause serious harm fr om unnecessar y treatment s. For example, t he committ ee w ere awar e 
of evidence t hat suggest ed that bor derline raised calcit onin can be caused b y Hashimot o's 
disease or cer tain drugs. This can in turn cause o ver-treatment and high le vels of 
morbidity . The f alse positiv es ma y cause a par ticularly lo w positiv e-predictiv e value 
because of t he relativ e rarity of medullar y thyroid cancer (MT C), wit h only 100 t o 150 new 
cases per y ear in t he UK. The committ ee therefore agr eed t hat f or most people it w ould be 
more useful and less harmful not t o use calcit onin t esting. Inst ead, ot her met hods of 
assessment should be used, such as fine-needle aspiration cyt ology (FNA C). 
However, the committ ee agr eed t hat t here were some people f or whom t he benefit s of Thyroid cancer: assessment and management (NG230)
© NICE 202 4. All right s reserved. Subject t o Notice of right s (https://www .nice.or g.uk/t erms-and-
conditions#notice-of -right s).Page 31 of
56
calcit onin t esting might outw eigh it s harms. This w ould include people at higher risk of 
MTC, for whom t he risks of f alse negativ es w ould outw eigh t he risks of f alse positiv es at a 
population le vel. This includes people wit h a family hist ory of MT C; those wit h multiple 
endocrine neoplasms; t hose wit h suspect ed MT C or MT C diagnosed b y cyt opat hology , 
core biopsy , or ot her hist opat hology; and people wit h C-cell h yperplasia. 
Ther efore, a r ecommendation was made t hat calcit onin should not be t ested routinely 
unless t here are prior r easons t o suspect MT C. 
Thyroid per oxidase antibody t esting 
The committ ee discussed fr om t heir e xperience ho w result s from t hyroid per oxidase 
antibody (TPO) t ests can f acilitat e interpretation of FNA C result s. For example, if t he FNA C 
result is suggestiv e of benign t hyroiditis, t hen a positiv e TPO t est ma y help t o confirm t his. 
A positiv e TPO t est ma y also allo w an indet erminat e result t o be do wngraded t o benign. 
Ther efore, the committ ee agr eed t hat TPO should be used t o facilitat e interpretation in 
cases wher e the FNA C result is uncer tain. Ho wever, wher e there is litt le uncer tainty about 
the FNA C result, t he committ ee did not t hink t he benefit s of TPO t esting justified it s use. 
Ther efore, the recommendation was made t hat TPO should not be r outinely measur ed but 
could be consider ed when t here was indet erminat e cyt opat hology . Given the uncer tainty 
in this ar ea the committ ee also made a recommendation f or resear ch on t hyroid 
peroxidase antibody t esting . 
How the r ecommenda tions mig ht affect practice 
The r ecommendation t o not off er calcit onin t esting unless MT C is suspect ed lar gely 
reflect s curr ent practice in t he UK. It also r epresent s a tar geted use of NHS r esour ces due 
to the rarity of MT C and high cost of t he test. The r ecommendation on TPO ma y lead t o an 
additional use of r esour ces but was consider ed impor tant t o avoid unnecessar y sur geries 
in people wit h benign nodules and indet erminat e cyt opat hology (f or example, people wit h 
Hashimot o's disease). It is t herefore expect ed to lead t o fewer unnecessar y 
thyroidect omies and ultimat ely impr ove the efficiency of t he NHS.

Why the c ommi ttee made the r ecommenda tions 
After considering t he diagnostic accuracy e vidence, t he committ ee eliminat ed all inde x 
tests that had sensitivity and specificity benchmarks belo w 0.9 and 0 .5, respectiv ely. 
These w ere the minimum pr e-hoc standar ds for first -line diagnostic t ests. Given that t here 
was e vidence f or simpler t echniques, such as gr eyscale ultrasound, t he committ ee also 
excluded t echniques t hat w ere impractical, unsuitable f or most people or in vasive. This 
included elast ograph y and contrast enhanced ultrasound. The committ ee also consider ed 
a simple combination of gr eyscale charact eristics and a doppler t est t hat used blood-
velocity measur ement. Ho wever, evidence f or bot h tests was tak en fr om single studies, 
which raised questions of r epresentativ eness, and t he doppler t est had impr ecision in t he 
sensitivity r esult. The only inde x tests remaining t hat fulfilled all crit eria of accuracy and 
clinical appr opriat eness w ere the or dinal scales of gr eyscale charact eristics. Ther efore,

The committ ee w ere also awar e that none of t he established syst ems ha ve per fect

They also agr eed t hat r epor ts of ultrasound findings should: 
• specify which grading syst em has been used f or the assessment 
• include inf ormation on t he charact eristics of t he nodule

• confirm t hat bot h lobes ha ve been assessed and

How the r ecommenda tions mig ht affect practice 
Recommending an established syst em for grading ultrasound appearance is not e xpect ed 
to aff ect curr ent practice significant ly. This is because t he recommendation does not stat e 
which syst em to use and t herefore it is unlik ely to persuade clinicians t o adopt a new

Thy1c was e xcluded fr om t he threshold because it w ould not benefit fr om ROSE. This is 
because Th y1c indicat es a non-diagnostic f or cystic lesion which is not operat or- or

How the r ecommenda tions mig ht affect practice 
Although dir ect smear is commonly used wit h FNA C, liquid-based cyt ology is less 
commonly used in smaller centr es. If a centr e adopt s liquid-based cyt ology , then some

Why the c ommi ttee made the r ecommenda tion 
For people who ha ve an inadequat e (Th y1) FNA C result s, the committ ee recommended 
that sampling should be r epeat ed. This was because an unsatisf actory aspirat e is oft en a 
random t echnical f ailure that might not be r epeat ed. The pr eferred appr oach f or repeat 
sampling is a cor e-needle biopsy (CNB) or FNA C wit h ROSE. This was because t he 
diagnostic clinical r eview of FNA C and CNB, and t he studies inf orming t he healt h 
economic model, f ound t hat CNB and FNA C wit h ROSE ar e mor e accurat e than r epeat 
FNAC and associat ed wit h a lo wer rat e of unsatisf actory result s. The committ ee 
recommended t hat, in some cases, FNA C alone could be per formed inst ead. F or example, 
if CNB and ROSE ar e not a vailable locally , or if t he nodule is near a blood v essel t hat w ould 
make the use of CNB wit h large needles inappr opriat e. Should t his fur ther t est still be 
Thy1, then t he committ ee thought t he best wa y to det ermine malignancy is b y diagnostic 
hemit hyroidect omy. 
For people wit h a cystic lesion (Th y1c), FNA C should be r epeat ed. This is because neit her 
CNB or FNA C wit h ROSE w ere consider ed useful f or non-diagnostic cystic samples. If t he 
second FNA C is also Th y1c and t he initial ultrasound appearances ar e concerning, t hen 
the committ ee agr eed t hat a diagnostic hemit hyroidect omy should be consider ed to 
establish t he diagnosis. 
To optimise t he sensitivity of FNA C testing, which was fractionally belo w the tar get of 
0.95, the committ ee recommended r epeating t ests that ar e benign (Th y2 or Th y2c). In t he 
first instance, t he committ ee agr eed t hat r epeating ultrasound should be consider ed. If 
this still pr oduces a suspicious r esult, t hen t he ne xt step w ould be t o repeat t he FNA C. 
CNB could be consider ed as an alt ernativ e to repeating FNA C, because alt hough it is 
invasive and mor e expensiv e than FNA C, it can e xtract mor e mat erial. Benign FNA C tests 
should be r epeat ed because sampling err or can sometimes cause f alse negativ es. 
Ther efore, if t he initial Th y2 result was caused b y sampling err or, a repeat t est is lik ely to 
return a positiv e result but, if it was not, t he repeat ed test will also be Th y2. The 
committ ee therefore recommended t hat people who ha ve had r epeat ed in vestigations, 
and t here is no e vidence of malignancy aft er these ar e complet e, can be dischar ged 
unless t here are other clinical concerns. 
The committ ee made a r epeat sampling r ecommendation f or people wit h Thy3a r esult s. 
The pr eferred appr oach is CNB, which r eflect s the findings of t he economic e valuation and 
clinical r eview . A consider r ecommendation was made, because in some cases a Th y3a 
sample ma y suggest a f ollicular lesion, which w ould not benefit fr om repeat sampling wit h Thyroid cancer: assessment and management (NG230)

CNB. FNA C is r ecommended as an alt ernativ e when CNB is una vailable or inappr opriat e. In 
case of a fur ther Th y3a r esult s, a r ecommendation was made t o use diagnostic 
hemit hyroidect omy or activ e sur veillance. 
For people wit h Thy3f r esult s, the committ ee recommended t hat diagnostic 
hemit hyroidect omy be consider ed. This r eflect ed the committ ee's view t hat r epeat 
sampling wit h FNA C or CNB is less useful aft er a suspect ed follicular lesion (Th y3f) and 
that diagnostic hemit hyroidect omy is justified b y the high risk of malignancy in t his gr oup 
(around 30%). Ther e were also concerns t hat, if not f ollowed up wit h sur gery, final 
diagnosis aft er Th y3f could tak e longer . This w ould dela y treatment f or a pot entially 
malignant tumour , create uncer tainty f or the person, and in some centr es lead t o a longer 
delay than is allo wed by NHS cancer tar gets. Alt hough t he committ ee agr eed t hat t his is 
current practice, a consider r ecommendation was made. This r eflect s the uncer tainty in 
the evidence and t he committ ee agr eed t hat t here ma y be some cases, f or instance in 
older people wit h severe comorbidities, wher e a hemit hyroidect omy for a Th y3f ma y not 
be appr opriat e. 
For people wit h Thy4 or Th y5 cyt ology , the committ ee recommended diagnostic or 
therapeutic hemit hyroidect omy, or t otal t hyroidect omy. The r ecommendation t hat people 
in these gr oups should be sent straight t o sur gery was based on e vidence t hat t he gr oups 
would contain a significant pr opor tion of people wit h malignancy . 
The economic model suggest ed that molecular t esting could be cost eff ectiv e in cer tain 
cytologies, par ticularly aft er a suspect ed follicular lesion (Th y3f), which w ould not benefit 
from repeat sampling. Ho wever, molecular t ests are not widely a vailable in t he NHS and 
are most ly produced out side t he UK. The committ ee agr eed t hat molecular t ests could 
help r educe t he number of unnecessar y diagnostic hemit hyroidect omies in people wit h 
indet erminat e FNA C result s and made a recommendation f or resear ch for molecular t ests. 
How the r ecommenda tion mig ht affect practice 
The r ecommendation t o off er CNB or FNA C wit h ROSE aft er a non-diagnostic Th y1

The r ecommendations t o repeat sampling wit h CNB aft er a Th y3a cyt ology is a significant

allow people t o maintain normal t hyroid function. The committ ee also agr eed t hat, 
although a hemit hyroidect omy might be chosen, some people might need a completion

Evidence sho wed that t hyrotropin alf a (also kno wn as r ecombinant human t hyroid

(THW) and did not demonstrat e any harms. The r elativ e benefit s from t hyrotropin alf a were 
improved quality of lif e, wellbeing, social, emotional and general function and r educed

Economic e vidence sho wed mix ed result s when t hyrotropin alf a was compar ed wit h THW .

Ther efore the committ ee agr eed t o tak e into account some original analysis t hat f ound a

Overall, t he committ ee agr eed t hat t hyrotropin alf a should be off ered to everyone. The y 
noted that some people might be harmed b y THW . People vulnerable t o the detrimental 
effects of THW include t hose wit h psy chiatric or mental healt h conditions, car diac

The committ ee also agr eed t hat t hyrotropin alf a is bett er than THW f or those who ar e not

carefully managed because it a voided a shor t-term r eduction in t heir quality of lif e. 
Finally , any rise in TSH has t he theor etical risk of causing flar e of t hyroid cancer . Due t o 
the sharp rise and high le vels of TSH f ollowing tr eatment wit h thyrotropin alf a, par ticular

Ther efore the committ ee decided t hat EBRT should be car efully consider ed on a person-

Recommendations 1 .5.1 to 1.5.6 
Why the c ommi ttee made the r ecommenda tions 
In the absence of e vidence, r ecommendations w ere made b y consensus. The committ ee 
discussed ho w measuring t hyroglobulin antibodies alongside t hyroglobulin was impor tant 
because t he pr esence of t hyroglobulin antibodies can aff ect t hyroglobulin le vels. This can 
increase t he number of f alse positiv e or f alse negativ e result s. The y also not ed that 
detectable t hyroglobulin le vels in people wit hout t hyroglobulin antibodies suggest s the 
presence of eit her r esidual t hyroid tissue or r esidual or r ecurr ent t hyroid malignancy . The y 
agreed t hat t he harms of t hyroglobulin measur ement, such as f alse positiv es leading t o 
over investigation, did not outw eigh t he clinical benefit s from early det ection of r ecurr ence 
or pr ogression. In t he absence of a f easible alt ernativ e met hod f or measuring r ecurr ence, 
the committ ee recommended measur ement of t hyroglobulin f ollowing a t otal or completion 
thyroidect omy wit h RAI. F requency of t hyroglobulin measur ement was r ecommended, in 
line wit h curr ent practice, at 3- t o 6-mont h intervals for the first 2  years, f ollowed by 6- t o 
12-mont h intervals aft er that. 
The committ ee agr eed t hat if t hyroglobulin antibodies ar e not det ected, t hen t hyroglobulin 
levels can be int erpreted at f ace v alue. In such a case, t his initial e vidence of r ecurr ence 
from t hyroglobulin t esting should lead t o fur ther in vestigations, eit her t o confirm or r efute 
recurr ence. The y also r ecommended t hat people who ha ve previously been clear ed of 
having r ecurr ence aft er a t hyroglobulin t est, but no w ha ve rising t hyroglobulin le vels, 
should also ha ve fur ther in vestigations f or recurr ence. This is because t he rise in 
thyroglobulin le vels might be a 'new' sign of r ecurr ence t hat r equir es in vestigation. F urther 
investigations could include neck ultrasound, CT scan of neck and chest or MRI scan of 
the neck. The choice oft en depends on local a vailability , and a prior kno wledge of what 
happened wit h the patient in assessing wher e in t he body r ecurr ence is most lik ely to be. 
The committ ee not ed that t here ma y be some cases wher e a person has had a t otal

not usually an indication f or fur ther in vestigations as oft en there will be a small amount of 
residual t hyroid tissue f ollowing t otal t hyroidect omy wit hout RAI. 
For people who ha ve not had a t otal t hyroidect omy, there would rar ely be a need t o 
measur e thyroglobulin le vels and int erpretation of r esult s can be difficult. This is because 
the person w ould still ha ve functioning t hyroid. Ther efore the committ ee recommended 
that t hyroglobulin le vels should not be r outinely measur ed. 
The committ ee also consider ed the mor e comple x scenario of what should happen if 
thyroglobulin antibodies ar e det ected abo ve the laborat ory threshold. Initially , the clinician 
would be e xpect ed to investigat e how the assa y might be aff ected by antibodies, and if it 
might cause an incr ease or decr ease in measur ed thyroglobulin le vels. This w ould 
influence ho w the thyroglobulin le vels ar e interpreted and, if t here was enough

also agr eed t hat t here should be fur ther in vestigations if , at a lat er point, eit her t he

these scenarios could, dir ectly or indir ectly, indicat e recurr ence. Ther efore the committ ee

The committ ee agr eed t o form r ecommendations b y consensus because no e vidence was

or highly sensitiv e thyroglobulin assa y. The y also suggest ed strat egies f or what t o do 
depending on t he result s obtained fr om using each met hod. 
When using stimulat ed thyroglobulin, t here were 3 le vels of r esponse suggest ed. A r eading 
of belo w 1 microgram/litr e was consider ed lo w risk, and led t o the recommendation t hat

recommendation t o consider continuation of TSH suppr ession. Finally , a reading of 
10 microgram/litr e or mor e led t o a recommendation t o consider fur ther in vestigations and 
treatment. The type of tr eatment w ould depend on what t he fur ther in vestigations 
revealed. This gradation of actions, fr om a r elaxation t o a str engt hening of vigilance, was 
based on t he changing per ception of r ecurr ence risk associat ed wit h the stimulat ed 
thyroglobulin measur ement s. 
When using a highly sensitiv e assa y that can det ect t hyroglobulin le vels lo wer than

0.2 microgram/litr e was consider ed lo w risk and led t o the recommendation t hat f ollow up 
and TSH suppr ession could be r elaxed. A r eading of betw een 0 .2 microgram/litr e and 
1.0 microgram/litr e led t o a recommendation t o consider stimulat ed thyroglobulin, which 
can be helpful in separating people int o lower- and higher -risk cat egories. If a person was 
shown to be at medium risk on stimulat ed thyroglobulin, t his w ould suggest continuing 
with the same strat egy and not r elaxing TSH suppr ession. But, if t hey were at high risk, 
this w ould indicat e the consideration of fur ther in vestigations and tr eatment. 
With all t hese r ecommendations, t he committ ee str essed t hat t he pr esence of anti-

were again based on t he committ ee's understanding of ho w quickly r ecurr ences and 
spread ma y occur . The committ ee ackno wledged t hat, while annual f ollow up is 
recommended, t here ma y be cases in which mor e frequent f ollow up is needed. The 
increasing duration of t otal f ollow up wit h the le vel of pr esumed risk was based on t he 
committ ee's e xperience t hat lat e recurr ence and spr ead incr eases wit h risk. Ther efore 
more prolonged vigilance is needed, and t he benefit outw eighs an y pot ential harms fr om 
follow up, such as anxiety about radiation. 
For an yone at t he highest le vels of risk, wit h persist ent biochemical or structural disease, 
there is t he pot ential f or disease pr ogression. Ther efore the committ ee recommended t hat 
follow up should occur annually f or an indefinit e period, and pot entially f or life. Finally , the 
committ ee discussed ho w thyroglobulin measur ement is designed t o identify r ecurr ence 
that ma y not y et be structurally e vident. Ther efore if structural r ecurr ence is det ected in 
people who ha ve been tr eated wit h total or completion t hyroidect omy and RAI, fur ther 
thyroglobulin measur ement is unnecessar y. Such people should be discussed in t he 
multidisciplinar y team meeting wit h the sur geon. 
Ther e was no e vidence f or ho w long people should be f ollowed up, so t he committ ee set 
minimum periods and wr ote a recommendation f or resear ch on t he duration of f ollow up. 
How the r ecommenda tions mig ht affect practice 
The impact of t he recommendations on practice is e xpect ed to be small, because t he 
recommendations r eflect curr ent practice.

Context 
Cancer of t he thyroid, a small gland at t he base of t he neck, is uncommon and can occur 
at an y age. It is most oft en diagnosed in people fr om t heir 20s t hrough t o their 60s. Almost 
all thyroid cancers (about 9 7%) ar e diff erentiat ed and ha ve a good pr ognosis. When 
deat hs do occur , they tend t o arise fr om t he spr ead of t he cancer t o the bones or lungs. 
Ther e has been an incr ease of o ver 150% in t he incidence of t hyroid cancer in t he UK o ver 
the past 30  years. It is unclear if t his is because of mor e eff ectiv e diagnosis or mor e 
people de veloping t hyroid cancer . The rise in incidence has not been mat ched b y a rise in 
mortality , but raises questions about assessment f or people wit h suspect ed thyroid cancer 
and about appr opriat e treatment. 
Ther e is par ticular uncer tainty about t he management of nodules of small and 
intermediat e siz e and classification, and practice v aries int ernationally . 
Thyroid cancer is usually tr eated by par tial (hemi-) or t otal t hyroidect omy, sometimes 
followed by radioactiv e iodine. Since t hyroid cancer can occur in y oung adult s and has a 
good pr ognosis, man y who ha ve this sur gery will spend most of t heir liv es wit hout a 
thyroid gland. The long-t erm implications of t his include lif elong tr eatment wit h 
replacement t hyroid hormone, and possible complications such as h ypoparat hyroidism and 
vocal cor d palsy . Internationally , very small t hyroid tumours ar e sometimes managed wit h 
activ e sur veillance. 
Once t hyroid cancer has been tr eated, t here is still a chance it might r ecur. Recurr ence is 
uncommon in w ell-diff erentiat ed cancers, but it can be mor e serious t han t he original 
occurr ence. Ther e are questions about t he risk of r ecurr ence and ho w this risk should be 
translat ed int o a long-t erm f ollow-up strat egy. Thyroid cancer: assessment and management (NG230)
