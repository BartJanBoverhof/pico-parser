Recommenda tions 
People ha ve the right t o be in volved in discussions and mak e informed decisions 
about t heir car e, as described in NICE's inf ormation on making decisions about y our 
care. 
Making decisions using NICE guidelines  explains ho w we use w ords to sho w the 
strengt h (or cer tainty) of our r ecommendations, and has inf ormation about 
prescribing medicines (including off -label use), pr ofessional guidelines, standar ds 
and laws (including on consent and mental capacity), and saf eguar ding. 
1.1 Informa tion and de cision suppor t for pe ople 
with pr ostate cancer, their par tner s and c arers 
Informa tion 
1.1.1 For advice on communication and patient -centr ed car e throughout t he patient 
journe y, follow the recommendations in t he NICE guidelines on patient e xperience 
in adult NHS ser vices  and improving suppor tive and palliativ e car e for adult s wit h 
cancer . [2008] 
1.1.2 Offer people wit h prostat e cancer inf ormation tailor ed to their o wn needs. This 
information should be giv en by a healt hcare professional (f or example, a 
consultant or specialist nurse) and ma y be suppor ted by writt en and visual 
media. [2008] 
1.1.3 Offer people wit h prostat e cancer advice on ho w to get inf ormation and suppor t 
from w ebsit es, local and national cancer inf ormation ser vices, and fr om cancer 
suppor t groups. [2008]

making, and ensur e that t hey have sufficient inf ormation t o do so. [2008] 
1.1.6 Use an up-t o-dat e decision aid in all ur ological cancer multidisciplinar y teams 
(MDTs). Healt hcare professionals trained in it s use should off er it t o people wit h 
localised pr ostat e cancer  when making tr eatment decisions. [2008] 
1.1.7 Use nomograms t oget her wit h people wit h prostat e cancer t o help: 
• with decision making 
• predict biopsy r esult s 
• predict pat hological stage 
• predict risk of tr eatment f ailure. [2008] 
1.1.8 Explain t he reliability , validity and limitations of an y predictions made using 
nomograms. [2008] 
1.1.9 Discuss all r elevant management options in t his guideline wit h people wit h 
prostat e cancer and t heir par tners or car ers, e ven if t hey are not a vailable 
through t heir local ser vices. [2008] 
1.1.10 Tell people wit h prostat e cancer: 
• about tr eatment options and t heir risks and benefit s in an objectiv e, unbiased 
manner and 
• that t here is limit ed evidence f or some tr eatment options. [2014] 
1.1.11 Ensur e that mechanisms ar e in place so people wit h prostat e cancer and t heir 
primar y car e providers ha ve access t o specialist ser vices t hroughout t he course 
of their disease. [2008] Prostat e cancer: diagnosis and management (NG131)

1.2 A ssessmen t and diagnosis 
MRI and biopsy 
1.2.1 Do not r outinely off er multiparametric MRI  to people wit h prostat e cancer who ar e 
not going t o be able t o have radical tr eatment. [2019] 
1.2.2 Offer multiparametric MRI as t he first -line in vestigation f or people wit h suspect ed 
clinically localised pr ostat e cancer . Repor t the result s using a 5-point Lik ert scale. 
[2019] 
1.2.3 Offer multiparametric MRI-influenced pr ostat e biopsy  to people whose Lik ert 
score is 3  or mor e. [2019] 
1.2.4 Consider omitting a pr ostat e biopsy f or people whose multiparametric MRI Lik ert 
score is 1  or 2, but only aft er discussing t he risks and benefit s wit h the person 
and r eaching a shar ed decision (see bo x 1). If a person opt s to have a biopsy , 
offer systematic pr ostat e biopsy . [2019] 
Ther e is mor e than 1  type of prostat e biopsy . The most common appr oach is transr ectal Prostat e cancer: diagnosis and management (NG131)

Box 1 F actors t o consider when discussing t he options f or people whose 
multipar ametric MRI Lik ert scor e is 1 or 2 
Advantages of under going pr ostat e biopsy 
You ma y have prostat e cancer t hat t he MRI scan missed: 
• betw een 11  and 28  out of 100  people wit h a lo w-risk MRI actually ha ve clinically 
significant cancer 
• there are man y eff ectiv e treatment s for clinically significant cancer , which w ork 
best f or disease t hat is caught early; t his means t hat, if y ou actually do ha ve 
clinically significant cancer t hat t he MRI missed, y ou will ha ve a bett er chance of 
long-t erm sur vival if t he biopsy finds it. 
Disadv antages of under going pr ostat e biopsy 
Ther e is no guarant ee that a pr ostat e biopsy will find an y disease t hat is t here. 
Prostat e biopsies find less t han half of t he clinically significant pr ostat e cancers t hat 
MRI scans miss. 
You ma y be diagnosed wit h clinically insignificant pr ostat e cancer . This is disease 
that is unlik ely to be lif e-threatening, but will need monit oring and ma y lead t o 
treatment. Ther efore, if someone has pr ostat e cancer t hat truly is clinically 
insignificant, it is bett er not t o find it. Betw een 18  and 23  out of 100  people wit h a 
low-risk MRI get a diagnosis of clinically insignificant pr ostat e cancer if t hey have a 
prostat e biopsy . 
The most common type of biopsy , transr ectal ultrasound-guided (TRUS), has some 
rare but impor tant complications. The most serious is sepsis, which de velops in a bit 
fewer than 1  out of 100  people. Ot her serious complications, including acut e urinar y 
retention, se vere haematuria and se vere rectal bleeding ma y need hospitalisation. 
TRUS biopsy has f ewer serious complications t hat mak e it unpleasant t o under go for 
some people. Prostat e cancer: diagnosis and management (NG131)

On a verage: 
• 3 out of 100  people f eel light -headed or dizzy immediat ely aft er the biopsy 
• 44 out of 100  people r epor t pain; in 15 of t hem, it will last f or at least 2  weeks; 7 
will consider it a moderat e or serious pr oblem 
• 20 out of 100  people de velop a f ever; in 3 of t hem, it will last f or at least 2  weeks; 
5 will consider it a moderat e or serious pr oblem 
• 66 out of 100  people ha ve blood in t heir urine; in 20 of t hem, it will last f or at least 
2 weeks; 6 will consider it a moderat e or serious pr oblem 
• 37 out of 100  people ha ve blood in t heir bo wel mo vement s; in 5 of t hem, it will 
last f or at least 2  weeks; 2 will consider it a moderat e or serious pr oblem

risks (including t he incr eased chance of ha ving t o live wit h the diagnosis of 
clinically insignificant pr ostat e cancer) and benefit s. [2008] 
1.2.8 If the clinical suspicion of pr ostat e cancer is high, because of a high PSA v alue 
and e vidence of bone metastases (identified b y a positiv e isot ope bone scan or 
scler otic metastases on plain radiographs), do not off er pr ostat e biopsy f or 
histological confirmation unless t his is needed as par t of a clinical trial. [2008] 
1.2.9 Have a cor e member of t he ur ological cancer MD T review t he risk f actors of all 
people who ha ve had a negativ e first pr ostat e biopsy . Discuss wit h the person 
that: 
• there is still a risk t hat pr ostat e cancer is pr esent and

Box 2 Factors t o consider when discussing activ e sur veillance, r adical 
prostat ectomy or r adical r adiot herapy as tr eatment options f or people wit h CPG  1, 
2 and 3 localised pr ostat e cancer , using e vidence fr om a lar ge UK trial 
What ar e the tr eatment options f or people wit h localised pr ostat e cancer? 
Ther e are 3 options f or treatment: 
• activ e sur veillance (t he trial used t he int ention-t o-treat met hod of analysis and 
some of t he patient s in t he activ e sur veillance arm ma y therefore have under gone 
prostat ectomy or radiot herap y during t he follow-up period) 
• radical pr ostat ectomy 
• radical radiot herap y. 
What eff ect does each tr eatment option ha ve on sur vival at 10  years? 
The e vidence does not sho w a diff erence in t he number of deat hs fr om pr ostat e 
cancer among people off ered activ e sur veillance, pr ostat ectomy or radical 
radiot herap y. 
People who had not died of pr ostat e cancer w ere: 
• 98 out of 100  patient s offered activ e sur veillance 
• 99 out of 100  patient s offered radical pr ostat ectomy 
• 99 out of 100  patient s offered radical radiot herap y.

Box 3 Factors t o consider when discussing t he option of docetax el chemot herapy 
for people wit h high-risk, non-metastatic pr ostat e cancer 
What does tr eatment wit h docetax el in volve? 
Docetax el chemot herap y is giv en at 6  appointment s, each 3  weeks apar t. It is giv en 
as an intra venous infusion t hat tak es about 1  hour. 
What ar e the benefit s of docetax el treatment f or people wit h high-risk, non-
metastatic pr ostat e cancer? 
Ther e is clear , high-quality e vidence t hat docetax el chemot herap y dela ys disease 
progression in people wit h high-risk, non-metastatic disease. 
In a lar ge UK randomised trial ( James et al. 2016 ), the average person who did not 
receiv e docetax el experienced disease pr ogression about 5  years aft er the star t of 
the trial, wher eas t he average person r eceiving docetax el experienced disease 
progression aft er about 6  years. 
We do not y et kno w whet her docetax el impr oves sur vival in people wit h high-risk, 
non-metastatic disease and w e will only be confident about whet her it does when 
trials ha ve been running f or longer . 
In a lar ge UK randomised trial, 80  out of 100  people wit h high-risk disease who did 
not r eceiv e docetax el were still aliv e aft er 5 years compar ed wit h 84  out of 
100 people who did. Ho wever, this diff erence could be because of chance. 
What ar e the risks associat ed wit h docetax el treatment? 
A lar ge UK randomised trial f ound t hat: 
• 15 out of 100  people who t ook docetax el de veloped f ebrile neutr openia (t hat is, 
they got a f ever because t he chemot herap y had r educed t heir whit e blood cells' 
ability t o fight inf ection).

opinion of t he in vestigat ors, t hey might not ha ve developed if t hey had not 
receiv ed docetax el. 
• 8 out of 100 people who t ook docetax el felt unusually w eak or tir ed. 
• 8 out of 100 people who t ook docetax el experienced gastr ointestinal sympt oms 
(including diarrhoea, abdominal pain, constipation and/or v omiting). 
• 5 out of 100 people who t ook docetax el experienced r espirat ory sympt oms 
(including br eathlessness and/or chest inf ections). 
• 4 out of 100 people who t ook docetax el experienced pr oblems wit h their ner vous 
systems (f or example, numbness or w eakness). 
• 1 out of 100 people who t ook docetax el experienced pr oblems wit h their nails 
that w ere serious enough t o interfere wit h their daily liv es.

Multipar ametric MRI o f the pr ostate 
An MRI study t hat incorporat es anat omical and functional inf ormation about t he pr ostat e. 
The minimum functional inf ormation includes T2-w eight ed, diffusion-w eight ed imaging 
and dynamic contrast -enhanced imaging. 
Multipar ametric MRI -influenc ed prostate biopsy 
The inf ormation fr om t he multiparametric MRI scan tak en bef ore prostat e biopsy is used t o 
determine t he best needle placement. In rar e cases, t he biopsy ma y be MRI-guided (t he 
needle is inser ted wit hin the MRI machine). In most cases, t he biopsy t hat f ollows the 
multiparametric MRI will be ultrasound-guided, but t he specific ar ea(s) tar geted will be 
predet ermined b y the multiparametric MRI data. 
Prostatectomy 
Surgery to remove par t, or all of t he pr ostat e gland. Radical pr ostat ectomy aims at t he 
removal of t he entir e prostat e gland and lymph nodes. This can be done b y an open 
appr oach or b y keyhole t echnique (lapar oscopic or r obotically assist ed lapar oscopic 
prostat ectomy). 
Prostate biopsy 
Templat e biopsy and mapping t emplat e biopsy 
A templat e biopsy is normally done under a general anaest hetic, and in volves taking 
transperineal cor e biopsies using a grid syst em. This might in volve taking multiple cor es 
from multiple sit es, but usually 2  to 3 cores from 8  sites. A mapping t emplat e biopsy is 
when 20  sites ar e syst ematically sampled, wit h 2 or 3 cores per sit e, sometimes meaning 
over 50  core biopsies ar e tak en. 
Local anaest hetic tr ansperineal biopsy 
This is sampling 6  or 8 sites from t he pr ostat e using a transperineal r oute under local 
anaest hetic. Prostat e cancer: diagnosis and management (NG131)

Transr ectal ultr asound-guided biopsy (TRUS) 
This is when cor e biopsies of t he pr ostat e are tak en via t he rectum under local 
anaest hetic. 
Syst ematic v ersus MRI-influenced (tar geted) biopsy 
The sit e for biopsy can be tar geted based on multiparametric MRI findings, or 
systematically but not guided b y MRI. Most oft en there is a combination of bot h tar geted 
and syst ematic MRI. The met hod used f or the biopsy can be eit her transperineal or TRUS. 
Watchful w aiting 
This is par t of a strat egy f or 'contr olling' rat her t han 'curing' pr ostat e cancer and is aimed 
at people wit h localised pr ostat e cancer who do not e ver wish t o have curativ e treatment, 
or it is not suitable f or them. Inst ead, it in volves the def erred use of hormone t herap y.

Rationale and im pact 
These sections briefly e xplain wh y the committ ee made t he recommendations and ho w 
they might aff ect practice. The y link t o details of t he evidence and a full description of t he 
committ ee's discussion. 
MRI and biopsy 
Recommendations 1 .2.1 to 1.2.5 
Why the c ommi ttee made the r ecommenda tions 
The committ ee saw no new e vidence t o suggest t hat an y changes w ere needed t o the 
recommendations on imaging in people who ar e not going t o have radical tr eatment. 
Ther e was good e vidence t hat sho wed that multiparametric MRI is useful in identifying 
lesions bef ore biopsy , and t he combination of MRI wit h prostat e biopsy leads t o bett er 
identification of clinically significant pr ostat e cancer t han syst ematic pr ostat e biopsy 
alone. The committ ee recommended using a 5-point Lik ert scale because t his scale tak es 
into account clinical f actors and not just t he lesion siz e, impr oving t he diagnostic ability of 
multiparametric MRI. 
The committ ee made a r ecommendation t o consider omitting pr ostat e biopsy f or people 
whose multiparametric MRI Lik ert scor e is 1  or 2 because t here was some e vidence t hat 
this is saf e to do. Ho wever, there is a small risk t hat in some cases significant cancers ma y 
be missed, so t he committ ee recommended clinicians discuss t he risk and benefit s wit h 
the person. 
Based on t heir e xper tise and economic e vidence, t he committ ee recommended not 
offering mapping transperineal t emplat e biopsy as an initial biopsy , because t he technique 
is curr ently too resour ce int ensiv e to be used as an initial assessment – it r equir es general 
anaest hetic and e xtensiv e hist ological analysis. The committ ee recognised t hat t his 
technique could be allo wed as par t of a clinical trial because it is oft en used as t he 
benchmark or gold standar d test in t hose trials. The committ ee did not see an y evidence 
that allo wed them t o clearly diff erentiat e betw een transperineal (non-mapping) and 
transr ectal biopsy , so it agr eed t o refer to 'prostat e biopsy' t hroughout t he Prostat e cancer: diagnosis and management (NG131)

recommendations. 
As there was limit ed evidence on t he most eff ectiv e pat hway for excluding clinically 
significant pr ogression of pr ostat e cancer in people wit h low to intermediat e risk, t he 
committ ee made a r ecommendation f or resear ch on t his topic. The y also identified t hat 
there was a gap in t he evidence on t he most suitable sur veillance pr otocol in t his 
population gr oup. 
How the r ecommenda tions mig ht affect practice 
The r ecommendations should not ha ve a significant r esour ce impact as man y centr es 
already per form MRI-influenced biopsy . Since all people who ha ve a biopsy will pr eviously 
have had an MRI, using t he MRI t o tar get t he biopsy will be mor e efficient and need f ewer 
biopsy cor es to be tak en. Healt h economic e vidence sho ws that MRI-influenced pr ostat e 
biopsy ma y be mor e cost eff ectiv e than syst ematic pr ostat e biopsy as it tak es less time 
and is mor e efficient in identifying clinically significant cancer .

Recommendations 1 .2.10 to 1.2.13 
Why the c ommi ttee made the r ecommenda tions 
Ther e was no clinical e vidence in t his ar ea, therefore the committ ee used e vidence fr om 
economic modelling t hat sho wed people wit h a negativ e diagnosis of pr ostat e cancer can 
still be at substantial risk of ha ving pr ostat e cancer , so f ollow up is impor tant. The 
evidence sho wed that t he pr evalence of initially undet ected, but clinically significant, 
prostat e cancer v aries based on a person's diagnostic hist ory, so t heir diagnostic hist ory 
should influence t he fr equency of f ollow up. 
The committ ee recommended t hat people wit h a Lik ert 3 score should be discussed at a 
multidisciplinar y team (MD T) meeting. It made t he recommendation because t hese cases 
can be difficult t o deal wit h. Scoring of scans ma y fluctuat e by 20% betw een rat ers and 
therefore a discussion in an MD T is warrant ed. The committ ee not ed that t his does not 
necessarily imply t he full cancer MD T, but is subject t o local arrangement. Prostat e cancer: diagnosis and management (NG131)

The f ollow-up strat egies r ecommended f or primar y car e are based on standar d prostat e-
specific antigen (PSA) t ests, wit h which primar y car e healt hcare professionals ar e familiar . 
The committ ee agr eed it was impor tant t hat specialist healt hcare professionals should 
calculat e thresholds f or re-referral and pr ovide t hese when dischar ging people, rat her t han 
expecting t he calculations t o be made in primar y car e. 
The r ecommendations in NICE's pr evious guidance on PCA3 assa y and t he Pr ostat e Healt h 
Index (NICE diagnostic guidance 17) ar e updat ed by this guideline. The committ ee saw no 
evidence t hat eit her t echnique r epresent s an eff ectiv e use of NHS r esour ces in t he 
follow up of people who ha ve had a negativ e transr ectal ultrasound-guided (TRUS) 
prostat e biopsy , and t herefore the committ ee did not r ecommend use of t hese 
technologies. 
The committ ee identified a gap in t he evidence f or the per formance of transperineal r oute 
(non-mapping) biopsy , and t herefore made a r ecommendation f or resear ch in t his ar ea. 
The committ ee also not ed that t here is limit ed long-t erm f ollow-up e vidence on t he natural 
history of people whose multiparametric MRI Lik ert scor e is 1  or 2. In addition, t here is 
limited evidence on t he number of people whose multiparametric MRI is Lik ert scor e 1 or 2, 
who ha ve normal PSA density and kinetics and who ar e found t o have clinically significant 
cancer . Further r ecommendations f or resear ch w ere made in t hese ar eas t o help pr ovide 
evidence acr oss t he pr ostat e cancer tr eatment pat hway. 
How the r ecommenda tions mig ht affect practice 
Currently, there is substantial v ariation in clinical practice in t he follow up of people wit h a 
negativ e prostat e biopsy . The committ ee's r ecommendations should help t o standar dise 
practice. 
Other r ecommendations made b y the committ ee mak e it lik ely that mor e people will ha ve a 
negativ e diagnosis on t he basis of lo w-risk multiparametric MRI findings and no biopsy . 
This is a new population who will need eff ectiv e follow-up strat egies, and t he 
recommendations giv e guidance on appr oaches t hat ar e likely to provide a good balance 
of benefit s, harms and cost s for this gr oup. 
The committ ee w ere confident t hat none of t he recommendations w ould ha ve a significant 
resour ce impact, as t hey are based on PSA measur ement s that ar e commonly used wit hin 
primar y car e settings. In addition, if fur ther multiparametric MRI is needed during Prostat e cancer: diagnosis and management (NG131)

Recommendation 1 .2.15 
Why the c ommi ttee made the r ecommenda tion 
The 2019 guideline used a 3-tier model f or risk stratification. The committ ee agr eed t hat 
newer evidence sho ws 5-tier risk stratification models ar e bett er at pr edicting pr ostat e 
cancer -specific mor tality t han 3-tier models. Mor e accurat e prognosis will mean t hat mor e 
people ar e giv en the most eff ectiv e treatment. The committ ee recommended t he 5-tier 
Cambridge Pr ognostic Gr oup (CPG) model o ver ot her 5-tier models because it has been 
tested in UK populations. 
Impact on other r ecommenda tions 
The committ ee consider ed the impact of r ecommending t he CPG risk stratification model 
on ot her r ecommendations in t he guideline. R ecommendations w ere amended as 
necessar y, taking int o account t he original e vidence f or each r ecommendation and t he 
committ ee's kno wledge and e xperience. 
How the r ecommenda tion mig ht affect practice 
The committ ee w ere confident t hat r ecommending t he 5-tier CPG risk stratification model 
would not ha ve a significant r esour ce impact. This was because PSA, Gleason scor e and 
clinical stage ar e used t o calculat e bot h the CPG model and t he pr eviously r ecommended 
3-tier model. The CPG uses an int egrat ed tumour (T) stage based on combined clinical, 
radiological and pat hological inf ormation t o classify T1 , T2, T3 and T 4 cancers wit hout 
further sub-division. MD Ts will need t o be awar e of t he new 5-tier model when assessing 
patient risk. Prostat e cancer: diagnosis and management (NG131)

recommendations t hat w ere previously f or people at 'int ermediat e risk' w ould no w apply t o 
a smaller gr oup. Most people in CPG  4 and CPG  5 align t o the pr evious 'high-risk' gr oup, so 
the number of people in t his cat egor y would not substantially change. These changes ar e 
not e xpect ed to aff ect tr eatment choices in a wa y that w ould ha ve a significant r esour ce 
impact.

Bone sc ans f or ne wly diagnose d prostate cancer 
Recommendation 1 .2.16 
Why the c ommi ttee made the r ecommenda tion 
The 2019 guideline r ecommended t hat bone scans should not be used f or people wit h 
low-risk pr ostat e cancer . This r ecommendation was amended t o refer to the CPG  1 and 2 
populations. The committ ee w ere awar e that t his population is br oader t han t he original 
low-risk population, but agr eed t hat it was in line wit h curr ent practice not t o off er bone 
scans t o these gr oups because t hey have very low risks of bone metastases. The 
committ ee highlight ed the lack of e vidence on when t o off er staging in vestigations t o the 
CPG 3 group and t he pot ential r esour ce impact of t he in vestigations, and made a 
recommendation f or resear ch in t his ar ea. 
How the r ecommenda tion mig ht affect practice 
Recommendations wher e low risk was r eplaced wit h CPG  1 and 2 will apply t o a br oader 
population due t o the inclusion of people wit h T2b pr ostat e cancer . However, the 
committ ee agr eed t hat t he associat ed resour ce impact of t his change w ould be minimal 
because it is in line wit h curr ent practice.

Why the c ommi ttee made the r ecommenda tions 
Choosing betw een tr eatment options 
The committ ee agr eed t hat activ e sur veillance, radical radiot herap y and radical 
prostat ectomy ma y be suitable f or diff erent people. Ther efore, it included a pr eference 
decision bo x for clinicians t o use t o help people wit h prostat e cancer mak e the right choice 
for themselv es. The inf ormation in t he bo x comes fr om t he UK Pr otecT trial, which 
included people wit h CPG  1 to 3 pr ostat e cancer . However, the committ ee not ed that 
people wit h CPG  3 prostat e cancer comprised a small pr opor tion of t he people in t his trial. 
Ther efore, the inf ormation in t he bo x might not dir ectly apply t o this gr oup, but ma y still be 
useful when discussing t he risk of side eff ects for diff erent tr eatment options. 
CPG  1 prostat e cancer 
The 2019 guideline r ecommended t hat a choice of activ e sur veillance, radical radiot herap y 
or radical pr ostat ectomy should be off ered to people wit h low-risk pr ostat e cancer 
(equiv alent t o the CPG  1 group in t he 5-tier model t hat is no w recommended). The 
committ ee not ed that since t he 2019 guideline was published, practice in t his ar ea has 
changed and t here is no w mor e concern about o vertreatment of lo w-risk cancer . The y 
noted that t he UK Pr otecT trial, which is most applicable t o the population wit h CPG  1 
prostat e cancer , sho wed statistically significant benefit fr om radical tr eatment and a 
higher risk of adv erse e vents. It was t herefore recommended t hat activ e sur veillance 
should be off ered to people wit h CPG  1 prostat e cancer and radical tr eatment consider ed 
if activ e sur veillance is not acceptable or unsuitable. 
CPG  2 pr ostat e cancer 
In the 2019 guideline, radical tr eatment was r ecommended f or people wit h intermediat e-
risk pr ostat e cancer , with activ e sur veillance consider ed if t his was unacceptable t o the 
person wit h prostat e cancer . The CPG model divides t his int ermediat e-risk gr oup int o 
CPG 2 and CPG  3 prostat e cancer and t he committ ee made diff erent r ecommendations f or 
these gr oups because t hey have diff erent risks of pr ostat e cancer r elated mor tality . The Prostat e cancer: diagnosis and management (NG131)

committ ee recommended t hat people wit h CPG  2 prostat e cancer should be off ered a 
choice of radical pr ostat ectomy, radical radiot herap y or activ e sur veillance. The Pr otecT 
trial included people wit h CPG  2 prostat e cancer . However, the risk of pr ostat e cancer 
related mor tality is higher in t he CPG  2 population t han in people wit h CPG  1 prostat e 
cancer and so t he choice betw een activ e sur veillance and radical tr eatment is mor e finely 
balanced. 
CPG  3 pr ostat e cancer 
Radical pr ostat ectomy or radical radiot herap y was r ecommended f or people wit h CPG  3 
prostat e cancer , in line wit h the 2019 r ecommendation f or people wit h intermediat e-risk 
prostat e cancer . This is because t he risk of pr ostat e cancer r elated mor tality is higher f or 
this gr oup t han t he CPG  2 group and t he committ ee thought t hat t he sur vival benefit fr om 
radical tr eatment w ould lik ely outw eigh t he side eff ects. The committ ee also 
recommended t hat activ e sur veillance could be consider ed if radical tr eatment is 
unacceptable t o the patient, in line wit h the 2019 r ecommendation. 
CPG  4 and 5 pr ostat e cancer 
The 2019 r ecommendation not t o off er activ e sur veillance t o people wit h high-risk 
prostat e cancer was updat ed to refer to people wit h CPG  4 and 5 pr ostat e cancer . The 
committ ee agr eed t hat t hese gr oups w ere equiv alent, and t hat activ e sur veillance w ould 
not be a suitable tr eatment option f or these people. 
How the r ecommenda tions mig ht affect practice 
Recommendations wher e low risk was r eplaced wit h CPG  1 are likely to apply t o a br oader

Why the c ommi ttee made the r ecommenda tions 
The committ ee made r ecommendations based on a good body of e vidence t hat 
multiparametric MRI can be used as par t of an activ e sur veillance pr otocol t o identify 
clinically significant cancer , or r estage pr ostat e cancer aft er diagnosis. The committ ee 
took int o account t he benefit s seen in using multiparametric MRI pr e-biopsy in people who 
have not had a biopsy and who ha ve suspect ed pr ostat e cancer . The committ ee 
concluded t hat t his benefit can be e xtended t o people ha ving activ e sur veillance wit hout 
having had an MRI t o allo w for confirmation or r eclassification of t he pr ostat e cancer . 
The committ ee amended t he pr otocol f or activ e sur veillance based on t heir e xper tise and 
good e vidence on PSA-deriv ed measur es to monit or, and t he use of multiparametric MRI 
to identify , clinically significant pr ostat e cancer . The committ ee kept t he use of digital 
rectal e xamination (DRE) in t his population because t hey did not see an y new e vidence t o 
not r ecommend it f or this gr oup. In addition, DRE was par t of t he pr otocol in 1 of t he 
studies included in t he evidence r eview . 
Because of t he limit ed evidence on t he most eff ectiv e pat hway for excluding clinically 
significant pr ogression of pr ostat e cancer in people wit h low to intermediat e risk, t he 
committ ee made r ecommendations f or resear ch in t his ar ea. The y also identified t hat t here 
was a gap in t he evidence on t he most suitable sur veillance pr otocol f or this population 
group, including t he use of DRE. 
How the r ecommenda tions mig ht affect practice 
The use of multiparametric MRI in people who ar e enr olled on activ e sur veillance will 
influence activ e sur veillance pr otocols acr oss t he countr y. Multiparametric MRI is clinically 
and cost eff ectiv e, because clinically significant cancers ar e mor e likely to be identified, 
therefore decisions on tr eatment can be made earlier in t he diagnosis pat hway saving on 
futur e treatment cost s.

The 2014 and 2019 r ecommendations on hormone tr eatment and brach ytherap y for 
intermediat e and high-risk pr ostat e cancer w ere amended t o cover the CPG  2 to 5 gr oups. 
The committ ee agr eed t hese gr oups ar e broadly equiv alent t o the gr oups in t he 2019

In 2019 , the committ ee consider ed a lar ge body of e vidence sho wing t hat 
hypofractionat ed radiot herap y and con ventional radiot herap y were equally eff ectiv e. The 
committ ee not ed that h ypofractionat ed radiot herap y is associat ed wit h higher rat es of 
acute gastr ointestinal t oxicity , but o verall it could enable people t o have a bett er quality of 
life because t hey would need t o mak e fewer clinic visit s. Fewer clinic visit s for 
hypofractionat ed radiot herap y would also mean f ewer resour ces w ere needed compar ed 
with con ventional radiot herap y treatment. Ther efore, hypofractionat ed radiot herap y was 
recommended as t he first option. 
The committ ee agr eed t hat 60  Gy in 20  fractions was t he optimal dose f or people ha ving 
hypofractionat ed radiot herap y. This was t he dosage used in t he lar ge UK CHHiP trial t hat 
was associat ed wit h greater efficacy compar ed wit h a 57  Gy schedule, alt hough t he 60  Gy 
schedule did also sho w slight ly greater toxicity .

Why the c ommi ttee made the r ecommenda tions 
Ther e was some e vidence t hat sho wed zoledr onic acid pr olonged t he time wit hout 
skeletal-r elated events in people wit h hormone-r efract ory metastatic pr ostat e cancer . 
However, the committ ee could not mak e a str onger r ecommendation because t he 
evidence did not sho w whet her z oledr onic acid aff ects mor tality in t his population. 
Ther e was no new e vidence t hat could aff ect t he existing r ecommendation on t he

How the r ecommenda tions mig ht affect practice 
Ther e ma y be a small incr ease in t he cost of hormone-r efract ory metastatic pr ostat e

Context 
Prostat e cancer is t he most common cancer in men, and t he second most common cancer 
in the UK. In 2014 , there were over 46 ,000 new diagnoses of pr ostat e cancer , which 
account s for 13% of all new cancers diagnosed. About 1  in 8 people will get pr ostat e 
cancer at some point in t heir lif e. 
Prostat e cancer can also aff ect trans w omen, as t he pr ostat e is usually conser ved aft er 
gender -confirming sur gery, but it is not clear ho w common it is in t his population. 
More than 50% of pr ostat e cancer diagnoses in t he UK each y ear ar e in people aged 
70 years and o ver (2012), and t he incidence rat e is highest in people aged 90  years and 
over (2012 t o 2014). Out of e very 10 prostat e cancer cases, 4  are only diagnosed at a lat e 
stage in England (2014) and Nor thern Ir eland (2010  to 2014). Incidence rat es ar e project ed 
to rise b y 12% betw een 2014 and 2035 in t he UK t o 233  cases per 100 ,000 in  2035 . 
A total of 84% of people aged 60  to 69  years at diagnosis in 2010/2011 ar e predict ed to 
survive for 10  or mor e years aft er diagnosis. When diagnosed at t he earliest stage, 
virtually all people wit h prostat e cancer sur vive 5 years or mor e: this is compar ed wit h less 
than a t hird of people sur viving 5  years or mor e when diagnosed at t he lat est stage. 
Ther e were appr oximat ely 11 ,000 deat hs fr om pr ostat e cancer in 2014 . Mor tality rat es from 
prostat e cancer ar e highest in people aged 90  years and o ver (2012  to 2014). Ov er the 
past decade, mor tality rat es ha ve decr eased b y mor e than 13% in t he UK. Mor tality rat es 
are project ed to fall by 16% betw een 2014 and 2035 t o 48  deat hs per 100 ,000 people 
in 2035 . 
People wit h an African f amily back ground ar e at higher risk of pr ostat e cancer (lif etime risk 
of appr oximat ely 1  in 4). Pr ostat e cancer is in versely associat ed wit h depriv ation, wit h a 
higher incidence of cases f ound in mor e affluent ar eas of t he UK. 
Cost s for the inpatient tr eatment of pr ostat e cancer ar e predict ed to rise t o £320 .6 million 
per y ear in 2020 (fr om £27 6.9 million per y ear in  2010).

Since t he updat e in 2014 , there have been changes in t he wa y that pr ostat e cancer is 
diagnosed and tr eated. Adv ances in imaging t echnology , especially multiparametric MRI, 
have led t o changes in practice, and new e vidence about some pr ostat e cancer tr eatment s 
means t hat some r ecommendations needed t o be updat ed. 
Since t he updat e in 2019 t here has been new e vidence on risk cat egorisation models f or 
localised and locally adv anced pr ostat e cancer . Ther efore, recommendations on risk 
categorisation and subsequent r ecommendations on tr eatment s for diff erent risk 
categories needed t o be updat ed. Prostat e cancer: diagnosis and management (NG131)
