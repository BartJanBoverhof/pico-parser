Recommenda tions 
People ha ve the right t o be in volved in discussions and mak e informed decisions 
about t heir car e, as described in NICE's inf ormation on making decisions about y our 
care. 
Making decisions using NICE guidelines  explains ho w we use w ords to sho w the 
strengt h (or cer tainty) of our r ecommendations, and has inf ormation about 
prescribing medicines (including off -label use), pr ofessional guidelines, standar ds 
and laws (including on consent and mental capacity), and saf eguar ding. 
1.1 De tection in primar y care 
Recommendations in t his section ha ve been incorporat ed int o NICE's guideline on 
suspect ed cancer . 
1.1.1 A wareness o f sym ptoms and signs 
1.1.1.1 Refer the w oman using a suspect ed cancer pat hway referral  if physical 
examination identifies ascit es and/or a pelvic or abdominal mass (which is not 
obviously ut erine fibr oids). 
1.1.1.2 Carry out t ests in primar y car e (see t he section on asking t he right question – first 
tests) if a w oman ( especially if 50 or o ver) repor ts having an y of t he following 
sympt oms on a persist ent or fr equent basis – par ticularly mor e than 12 times per 
mont h: 
• persist ent abdominal dist ension (w omen oft en refer to this as 'bloating') 
• feeling full ( early satiety) and/or loss of appetit e 
• pelvic or abdominal pain 
• increased urinar y urgency and/or fr equency . Ovarian cancer: r ecognition and initial management (CG122)

1.1.2.3 If the ultrasound suggest s ovarian cancer , refer the w oman f or fur ther 
investigation using a suspect ed cancer pat hway referral . 
1.1.2.4 For an y woman who has normal serum CA 125 (less t han 35  IU/ml), or CA 125 of 35 
IU/ml or gr eater but a normal ultrasound: 
• assess her car efully f or ot her clinical causes of her sympt oms and in vestigat e 
if appr opriat e 
• if no ot her clinical cause is appar ent, advise her t o return t o her GP if her 
sympt oms become mor e frequent and/or persist ent. Ovarian cancer: r ecognition and initial management (CG122)

Recommenda tions f or research 
The guideline de velopment gr oup has made t he following r ecommendations f or resear ch, 
based on it s review of e vidence, t o impr ove NICE guidance and patient car e in t he futur e. 
1 Relationship be tween dur ation o f sym ptoms o f 
ovarian c ancer and stag e at diagnosis 
Further r esear ch should be under taken on t he relationship betw een t he duration and 
frequency of sympt oms in w omen wit h ovarian cancer bef ore diagnosis, t he stage of 
disease at diagnosis and subsequent sur vival. 
Why this is im portant 
Most w omen pr esenting wit h ovarian cancer ha ve adv anced disease and ha ve had 
sympt oms f or mont hs. Gr eater awar eness among bot h women and healt hcare 
professionals might r esult in w omen pr esenting earlier wit h less adv anced disease, leading 
to bett er out comes. Ther e is insufficient understanding of t he factors t hat influence earlier 
diagnosis in w omen wit h ovarian cancer , especially t he relationship betw een duration of 
sympt oms and stage at diagnosis. Data demonstrating benefit s from earlier pr esentation 
will justify in vestment in raising awar eness among w omen and healt hcare professionals. 
This is lik ely to be a population-based study t hat r ecords bot h the duration and fr equency 
of sympt oms. 
2 Imag ing in the diagnostic pa thway for w omen 
with ovarian c ancer 
Large multicentr e case–contr ol studies should be conduct ed to compar e the accuracy of 
CT v ersus MRI f or staging and f or pr edicting optimal cyt oreduction in w omen wit h ovarian 
cancer . 
Why this is im portant 
Currently most w omen wit h ovarian cancer will under go a CT scan bef ore sur gery to Ovarian cancer: r ecognition and initial management (CG122)

assess t he extent and r esectability of disease. CT and MRI ar e complementar y in t heir 
abilities t o det ect disease, but no adequat e studies ha ve been per formed t hat compar e 
their eff ectiv eness in w omen wit h suspect ed ovarian cancer . No comparativ e studies ha ve 
been under taken evaluating sur gical out come. A pr ospectiv e study in w omen under going 
primar y sur gery would be f easible. 
3 The v alue o f primar y sur gery for w omen wi th 
advanced ovarian c ancer 
Resear ch should be under taken to det ermine t he eff ectiv eness of primar y sur gery for 
women wit h adv anced o varian cancer whose tumour cannot be fully e xcised. 
Why this is im portant 
Most w omen wit h adv anced o varian cancer under go sur gery at some point. Pr evious 
studies ha ve sho wn that sur gery aft er the completion of chemot herap y has no t herapeutic 
value. Studies ar e being per formed t o investigat e whet her t he timing of sur gery during 
primar y chemot herap y influences out come. No studies ha ve evaluat ed whet her primar y 
surgery itself has an y therapeutic v alue when compar ed wit h chemot herap y alone. The 
potential adv antages of sur gery have to be off set against t he morbidity , occasional 
mortality and undoubt ed cost s associat ed wit h it. This w ould be a pr ospectiv e randomised 
clinical trial r ecruiting w omen who ha ve biopsy-pr oven adv anced o varian cancer and who 
are fit enough t o receiv e sur gery and chemot herap y. Women w ould be randomised t o 
either chemot herap y and sur gery (conventional arm) or chemot herap y alone ( experimental 
arm). Primar y out come measur es w ould be sur vival at 1 and 5 y ears. Ovarian cancer: r ecognition and initial management (CG122)

Appendix: Risk o f malignanc y inde x (RMI 
I) 
RMI I combines 3 pr e-sur gical f eatur es: serum CA 125 (CA 125), menopausal status (M) and 
ultrasound scor e (U). The RMI is a pr oduct of t he ultrasound scan scor e, the menopausal 
status and t he serum CA 125 le vel (IU /ml). 
RMI = U x M x CA125 
• The ultrasound r esult is scor ed 1 point f or each of t he following charact eristics: 
multilocular cyst s, solid ar eas, metastases, ascit es and bilat eral lesions. U  = 0 (for an 
ultrasound scor e of 0), U  = 1 (for an ultrasound scor e of 1), U  = 3 (for an ultrasound 
score of 2 t o 5). 
• The menopausal status is scor ed as 1  = pre-menopausal and 3  = post-menopausal. 
• The classification of 'post -menopausal' is a w oman who has had no period f or mor e 
than 1  year or a w oman o ver 50 who has had a h ysterectomy. 
• Serum CA 125 is measur ed in IU /ml and can v ary betw een 0 and hundr eds or e ven 
thousands of unit s. Ovarian cancer: r ecognition and initial management (CG122)

Context 
Ovarian cancer is t he leading cause of deat h from gynaecological cancer in t he UK, and it s 
incidence is rising. It is t he fift h most common cancer in w omen, wit h a lif etime risk of 
about 2% in England and W ales. 
The out come f or women wit h ovarian cancer is generally poor , with an o verall 5-y ear 
survival rat e of less t han 35%. This is because most w omen who ha ve ovarian cancer 
present wit h adv anced disease. The stage of t he disease is t he most impor tant f actor 
affecting out come. The w oman's general healt h at t he time of pr esentation is also 
impor tant because it aff ects what tr eatment s can be used. Most w omen ha ve had 
sympt oms f or mont hs bef ore presentation, and t here are oft en dela ys betw een 
presentation and specialist r eferral. Ther e is a need f or gr eater awar eness of t he disease 
and also f or initial in vestigations in primar y and secondar y car e that enable earlier r eferral 
and optimum tr eatment. 
Despit e the relativ ely poor o verall sur vival rat es for ovarian cancer , there has been a tw o-
fold incr ease in sur vival over the last 30 y ears. This has coincided wit h the adv ent of 
effectiv e chemot herap y, and t he intr oduction of platinum-based agent s in par ticular , as 
well as changes in sur gical practice. Mor e recent ly, there has been a significant shift 
towards gr eater specialisation in t he deliv ery of car e, resulting fr om t he implementation of 
the Depar tment of Healt h's cancer ser vice guidance 'Impr oving out comes in 
gynaecological cancers' . It is lik ely that some or all of t hese changes ha ve contribut ed to 
the impr oved sur vival rat es, emphasising t he need t o ensur e that w omen wit h diagnosed 
ovarian cancer ar e treated in specialist centr es that can pr ovide compr ehensiv e cancer 
care. 
This guideline does not co ver the entir e car e pat hway for ovarian cancer . It focuses on 
areas wher e there is uncer tainty or wide v ariation in clinical practice wit h regar d to the 
detection, diagnosis and initial management of o varian cancer . The guideline 
recommendations ar e applicable t o women wit h epit helial o varian cancer (t he most 
common type of o varian cancer), as w ell as w omen wit h fallopian tube car cinoma, primar y 
perit oneal car cinoma or bor derline o varian cancer (see r ecommendations f or resear ch for 
further details). 
The guideline assumes t hat pr escribers will use a drug's summar y of pr oduct 
charact eristics t o inform decisions made wit h individual patient s. Ovarian cancer: r ecognition and initial management (CG122)
