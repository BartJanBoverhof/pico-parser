This guideline is t he basis of QS146 . 
Overview 
This guideline co vers assessing and managing cancers of t he upper aer odigestiv e tract in 
people aged 16 and o ver. These ar e cancers of t he air ways of t he head and neck, 
including t he mout h, throat, lar ynx (v oicebo x) and sinuses. It aims t o reduce v ariation in 
practice and impr ove sur vival. 
In June 2018 , we review ed the evidence f or treating adv anced cancer  and added 
recommendations on using FDG PET -CT scans t o inform decisions about sur gery aft er 
radical chemoradiot herap y. 
Who is i t for? 
• Healt hcare professionals w orking in secondar y and t ertiary car e 
• People aged 16 and o ver wit h cancer of t he upper aer odigestiv e tract, and t heir 
families and car ers Cancer of t he upper aer odigestiv e tract: assessment and management in people aged 16

Recommenda tions 
People ha ve the right t o be in volved in discussions and mak e informed decisions 
about t heir car e, as described in NICE's inf ormation on making decisions about y our 
care. 
Making decisions using NICE guidelines  explains ho w we use w ords to sho w the 
strengt h (or cer tainty) of our r ecommendations, and has inf ormation about 
prescribing medicines (including off -label use), pr ofessional guidelines, standar ds 
and laws (including on consent and mental capacity), and saf eguar ding. 
Stages of upper aer odigestiv e tract cancer 
The stages of upper aer odigestiv e tract cancer r eferred to in t his guideline ar e based 
on the TNM classification 7t h Edition: 
• T0: t his means t here is no primar y tumour , but t here ma y be abnormal cells t hat 
are precancer ous. 
• T1 to T4: this refers t o the incr easing siz e and/or e xtent of t he primar y tumour , 
with 1 being smallest and 4 lar gest. 
• N0: no lymph nodes contain cancer cells. 
• N1 and up wards: incr easing in volvement of lymph nodes b y cancer cells.

Why this is impor tant 
Outcomes of int erest include local contr ol, pr ogression-fr ee sur vival, overall sur vival, and

Rationale and im pact 
Response assessmen t after chemor adiother apy 
Recommendations 1 .5.1 to 1.5.4 
Why the c ommi ttee made the r ecommenda tions 
Overall, t he evidence sho wed that r ecurr ence rat es and o verall mor tality f or 
fluor odeo xyglucose positr on emission t omograph y (FDG  PET)-CT -guided management 
after radical chemoradiot herap y were similar t o those f or neck dissection. In addition, t he 
evidence sho wed that FDG  PET-CT was cost -saving compar ed wit h neck dissection, and 
would pr event unnecessar y sur geries, sur gical complications, and adv erse e vents. 
The committ ee agr eed t o mak e recommendations only f or people wit h orophar yngeal, 
laryngeal and h ypophar yngeal primar y sites, because t hese w ere the main f ocus of t he 
evidence. Most of t he people in t he study had an or ophar yngeal primar y site and mor e 
than 1 positiv e node under 6  cm acr oss in t he neck, and t he evidence was str ongest f or 
this population. Ther efore, the committ ee agr eed t hat t hey should be off ered an FDG  PET-
CT scan. 
The e vidence was w eaker for people wit h: 
• an or ophar yngeal primar y site and 'N2a' stage disease ( only 1 positiv e node of mor e 
than 3  cm but no mor e than 6  cm acr oss) 
• an or ophar yngeal primar y site and higher 'N' stage disease (1 or mor e positiv e node 
larger t han 6  cm acr oss in t he neck) 
• laryngeal or h ypophar yngeal primar y sites. 
To reflect t his, FDG  PET-CT scanning could be consider ed for these gr oups. 
The e vidence did not include people wit h an or ophar yngeal primar y site and 'N1' stage 
disease ( only 1 positiv e node of less t han 3  cm acr oss). Ho wever, the committ ee agr eed 
that it is par ticularly impor tant t hat FDG  PET-CT scans ar e consider ed for this population 
to avoid unnecessar y sur gery. These people ar e likely to be at a lo wer risk of r ecurr ence Cancer of t he upper aer odigestiv e tract: assessment and management in people aged 16

and so t he benefit s of neck dissection ar e lower. 
The committ ee not ed that new classifications f or head and neck cancer ( TNM 
classification of malignant tumours, 8t h edition ) have been intr oduced, which ar e diff erent 
from t hose used in t he evidence. The y decided t o describe t he stage of cancer f or these 
recommendations in t erms of t he number and siz e of positiv e nodes t o avoid confusion. 
The timing of FDG  PET-CT scans (3 t o 6 mont hs aft er completion of radical 
chemoradiot herap y) is in line wit h curr ent Royal College of Radiologist s guidelines on t he 
use of PET -CT. Scans earlier t han 3  mont hs ar e mor e likely to giv e a false-positiv e result, 
due t o the residual eff ects of tr eatment. 
The committ ee decided t o be specific t hat neck dissection should not be off ered to people 
with no abnormal FDG uptak e or r esidual soft tissue mass, t o giv e clear advice about ho w 
to interpret a 'negativ e' FDG  PET-CT r esult. 
The committ ee not ed se veral ar eas in which futur e resear ch w ould be helpful, such as 
management f or people wit h indet erminat e test result s (see resear ch recommendations 1 
and 2 ), the role of FDG  PET-CT f or people wit h nasophar yngeal cancer (see resear ch 
recommendation 3 ) and t he eff ectiv eness of FDG  PET-CT t o guide f ollow-up (see resear ch 
recommendation 4 ). 
How the r ecommenda tions mig ht affect practice 
Ther e ma y an incr ease in t he number of FDG  PET-CT scans per formed and a r eduction in 
surgical pr ocedur es. Ho wever, the evidence sho wed that t he amount of mone y saved fr om 
unnecessar y sur gery is lik ely to be considerably higher t han t he cost of t he additional 
scans.

Context 
Upper aer odigestiv e tract cancers ar e found at v arious sit es in t he air ways of t he head and 
neck: t he oral ca vity, orophar ynx, nasophar ynx, h ypophar ynx, lar ynx and nasal sinuses. 
The majority ar e squamous cell cancers. The major risk f actors f or upper aer odigestiv e 
tract squamous cell cancer in t he UK ar e tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption. 
Ther e is curr ently variation or uncer tainty in t he in vestigations used t o assess neck lumps; 
who needs syst emic staging, t he most eff ectiv e treatment f or early stage and adv anced

rehabilitation, t he most eff ectiv e follow-up and t he management of ost eoradionecr osis of 
the jaw . This guideline aims t o mak e recommendations t hat addr ess t hese ar eas of

This guideline will co ver adult s and y oung people (16  years and older): 
• referred fr om primar y car e wit h suspect ed cancer of t he upper aer odigestiv e tract 
• with newly-diagnosed or r ecurr ent cancer of t he upper aer odigestiv e tract. 
It will not co ver:
